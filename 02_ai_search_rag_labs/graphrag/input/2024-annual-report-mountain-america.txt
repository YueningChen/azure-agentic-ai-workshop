PRESIDENT'S REPORT
Credit unions are unique. By focusing on members and helping people along their financial journeys, we separate ourselves from other financial services providers. Mountain America Credit Union is committed to taking that difference to a whole new level. We have a fantastic and highly committed team that has done an incredible job of guiding our members through a challenging year.
Many of our members were negatively impacted by higher rates and inflation during 2024. This gave us the opportunity to be innovative as we searched for the best ways to support them. We did this by engaging our members through informative interactions and recommendations. The results have been meaningful.
OUR GROWTH
During the past year, we added over 100,000 net new members to our credit union. That growth came primarily through word-of-mouth recommendations from our membership-which is why this number is so impactful.
Mountain America is also among the top ten largest credit unions in the country with over $20 billion in assets. We are very proud of the way we have been able to assist our membership through the dedication of our 3,400 team members.
OUR COMMITMENT
We are committed to offering members the amazing experience they deserve. At the same time, we will strive to provide services in a safe and reliable manner while keeping your financial data secure.
We are dedicated to providing you with excellent value. We will invest in services that are convenient and easy to use. Our priority is to offer competitive rates on loans and savings accounts while providing technology that is efficient and dependable.
LIVES CHANGED
You may notice that as our team interacts with you, they will offer products or services to meet
your needs. We have found that we can impact members' lives by asking simple questions and providing helpful alternatives.
Every day we recognize opportunities to provide members with life-changing advice that saves them time and money, and reduces their financial stress. We thrive on helping our members find a plan to improve their financial future.
MOUNTAIN AMERICA DIFFERENCE
As you move toward your financial goals, I hope you see the Mountain America difference with every interaction. That difference comes from our dedicated team of staff and volunteers. They are here for you.
Thank you for your membership and the trust you place in us.

BENEFICIAL IMPACT
Mountain America has been recognized for its community impact and business growth.

SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE REPORT
CC Mountain America continues to be financially strong and well managed, with sound policies and programs to protect the members' assets."
2024 ANNUAL REPORT
The Supervisory Committee provides the membership with an independent assurance of the safety and soundness of Mountain America's operations and activities. The Committee consists of volunteers who ensure the operations are carried out in accordance with the Federal Credit Union Act, National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) regulations, and policies established by the Mountain America board of directors acting on behalf of credit union members.
The Committee oversees the internal audit function that evaluates the controls of the credit union on a continual basis. The Committee reviews all internal audit reports and meets monthly to discuss results, make recommendations for strengthening internal controls, and assess progress on all prior recommendations.
During 2024, internal audit conducted 31 information technology, operational and compliance audits.
The credit union's financial statements were audited by an independent certified
public accounting firm. In their opinion, the balance sheets and related statements of income present fairly in all material respects, the financial position and operational results of Mountain America in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The NCUA and CFPB also performed periodic regulatory examinations to ensure the credit union was operationally and financially safe and in compliance with the laws and regulations governing credit unions and overall member protections.
Based on the results of these internal and external audits and the examinations by regulators, it is the opinion of the Supervisory Committee that Mountain America continues to be financially strong and well managed, with sound policies and programs to protect the members' assets.

IMPROVING MEMBERS' LIVES
As a not-for-profit financial cooperative, one of the benefits Mountain America can provide our members is lower rates on loans and other financial incentives to improve their lives. Securing affordable financing or finding ways to reduce debt often facilitates opportunities for our members to follow their dreams. These stories from our members inspired us during 2024.
CARRYING ON HIS FATHER'S LEGACY
In 2010, Bill Boomen moved to Utah with his son, Rick, to open a Bath Fitter franchise. Rick was in high school at the time, but he learned everything he could from his dad about running a successful business.
2024 ANNUAL REPORT
When Bill passed away in 2018, Rick and his wife, Kayla, decided to carry on the family business. Rick shared that working with Mountain America as the company's financial partner- from everyday business accounts to construction and real estate loans-has allowed the Bath Fitter franchise to grow and thrive.
Rick appreciates being able to get his questions answered quickly and knowledgeably. He says, "It's nice to know there is someone in your corner- someone who wants to see you succeed as much as you do."

PAYING IT FORWARD AROUND THE WORLD
When Gaya Samarasingha and her husband moved to the U.S. from Sri Lanka to attend a university, they had only two suitcases and a few hundred dollars to their names. Inspired by her mother's entrepreneurial spirit, Gaya founded Kalaia-a skincare line using ingredients rooted in Sri Lankan beauty traditions.

Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. While many small businesses were closing their doors, a home equity loan from Mountain America allowed her to save her business. Gaya shared, "They gave me the attention I needed to figure out my best option, and I am very grateful for that."
Today, Gaya has a strong, growing company. In fact, a portion of every purchase goes directly to fund microloans for women establishing their own businesses-facilitating over 75 loans for women in 35 countries!
FROM FINANCIAL CHALLENGES TO HOMEOWNERSHIP
Juana Molina had always dreamed of owning a home in a safe neighborhood, but she thought it was impossible because of her low credit score. After moving to Utah and having some negative experiences at other financial institutions, Juana chose to join Mountain America, where she could communicate in her native language without feeling judged. "I feel very confident when I go to the credit union because I know there is someone who can speak with me in Spanish," Juana shared.
With guidance from a team member at her local branch, Juana and her husband worked diligently to improve their credit scores. Their efforts quickly paid off, and soon they were visiting the branch again to close on their

new home! Juana credits this achievement largely to the support they received from Mountain America.

CREATING A FAMILY OF HER OWN
Having grown up with three adopted brothers, Kelly Jo Doll had a lifelong dream to adopt a child. In 2015, she had the opportunity to travel to South Africa on a service trip, and she fell deeply in love with the country and its people-which led her to formally apply to adopt from South Africa.
Kelly Jo quickly learned, however, that international adoption is not cheap. She considered refinancing her home, but a Mountain America team member advised her against giving up her low interest rate, which included a military discount. Determined to find a financing option that would work for her budget, they devised a plan that reduced Kelly Jo's debt and ensured the financial stability needed for her growing family.
These stories are a few examples of members whose lives were changed with the financial guidance and support of Mountain America. Our commitment to guiding you forward on your financial journey will never change.
