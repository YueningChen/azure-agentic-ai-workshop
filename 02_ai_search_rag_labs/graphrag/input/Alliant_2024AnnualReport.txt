MESSAGE FROM THE CEO
As I reflect on the past year, I am filled with immense pride and gratitude for the incredible journey we have embarked on together. 2024 has been a transformative year for Alliant, marked by significant growth, pioneering digital transformation and unwavering dedication to our communities and our members.
Alliant continues to provide unparalleled financial strength and exceptional value to our members. Through competitive rates and a commitment to ensuring your financial security and convenience, we provided financial value of over $493 million to our members beyond what they would have received at an average bank.
Member experience has been a cornerstone of our achievements this year. We have expanded our product offerings to include seamless mobile account openings, which allows members to manage their investments and accounts right from the convenience of their mobile device. Additionally, we have implemented numerous strategies that increased our customer efficiency levels by over 20% to enhance overall member satisfaction and engagement. These improvements are a testament to your trust and confidence in Alliant; they fuel our commitment to delivering exceptional service.
Our digital transformation initiatives have redefined the way we interact with our members. We improved our digital platforms, making banking more accessible, secure and convenient. These innovations are designed to meet your
evolving financial needs and ensure you have the best possible experience with Alliant.
At the heart of everything we do, part of our newly launched mission statement is to do good for our communities and members. We have launched several impactful initiatives, such as our Million Dollar Challenge and Social Impact Day, promoting digital opportunity. Our commitment to social responsibility and community engagement remains unwavering and we are proud of the positive difference we are making in our communities.
In 2024, we reached an incredible milestone of bringing our total membership to over 900,000, entrusting us with over $16 billion in deposits. This incredible accomplishment could not have been achieved without the dedication of our Alliant teammates. Their hard work, passion and commitment to excellence have been essential in reaching this goal.
Thank you for your unwavering trust and support. I am excited about what we can achieve together in the year ahead.

WOWING OUR MEMBERS
Enhanced Member Support
In 2024, Alliant's Member Care Center significantly improved efficiency and service. We improved our call handling efficiency by 4.4%, resulting in 39,000 more successful member interactions. Additionally, our Member Care team dramatically reduced call times, giving 1.5 million minutes back to our members. These improvements have significantly increased our ability to provide efficient support and seamless member experience.
Banking Made Easy
Alliant has introduced several product improvements to make banking more convenient for our members. We simplified the process for funding new certificates by allowing external funding, so members no longer need to transfer funds into a shared account before opening a certificate. Additionally, our partnership with New York Times best-selling author Suze Orman has continued to provide our members with unique financial education and opportunities. From podcast episodes, blog posts and more, Suze and Alliant have what our members need to take their finances to the next level.
Investing in our Select Employer Group (SEG) Partnerships
Our various partnerships with our SEGs are rooted in financial wellness, consistent communications and the expansion of member services. In 2024, we introduced new content and resources to help members better manage their finances and achieve their financial goals, including workshops and webinars, online resources and a new SEG "Insider" Series to share information on our latest product offerings and services.

DOING GOOD FOR OUR MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES AND COMMUNITIES
Fostering Digital Opportunity
In collaboration with PCs for People, Alliant's annual electronic drives have made significant strides in having a positive impact on our local communities. With the help of our members and employee volunteers, we collected over 15,000 lbs. of laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other computer components in 2024. This partnership has a positive impact on underfunded communities by providing access to essential technology and supporting educational and professional opportunities for those in need.
Million Dollar Challenge in Action
As part of our commitment to promoting digital opportunity, Alliant distributed over $1.6 million to 15 organizations nationwide through the Million Dollar Challenge. This funding supported events like the Compudopt Digital Life Celebration, where 173 laptops and 128 high-speed internet devices were given to families in need of digital access. Our partnership with EveryoneOn and Visa at Super Bowl LVIII also helped promote digital access in underserved communities through the opening of The Community Access Lab in Las Vegas.
Empowering Our Employees to Enhance Member Experiences
In 2024, Alliant launched the New Employee Experience (NEX), an enhanced onboarding program that supports new hires from day one through their first 90 days with a comprehensive orientation to immerse them in our vibrant culture. In its second year, the Alliant Leader Academy has successfully trained 80 leaders across our organization. This development program drives organizational success by providing training in strategic thinking, workshops led by industry experts and mentorship from senior leaders. These initiatives equip our employees to provide the best possible experiences for our members.
