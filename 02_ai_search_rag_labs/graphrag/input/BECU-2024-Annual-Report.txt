REPORT TO MEMBERSHIP 2024
From Our Board Chair and President & CEO:
To our members,
This year, 2025, marks our 90th anniversary at BECU. What began in 1935 as a credit union dedicated to a small group of Boeing employees has now grown to over 1.5 million members and more than 3,200 employees serving your financial needs.
Much has changed in the world during that time. What remains steadfast is our commitment to the financial well-being of our members and the cooperative model that differentiates us from other financial institutions. As a credit union, we center our decisions around what is best for our members.
We are proud that BECU continued to deliver strong financial results in 2024. Our net worth ratio measures our financial strength in terms of how well-capitalized we are. It protects us against unforeseen losses. Last year, we hit a very strong 11.84%, providing continued safety and soundness for the credit union. That means we can weather future storms and continue investing back into our members and communities for the long-term.
We are always looking at how we can improve your experience, whether you choose to engage with us in-person, digitally or through our Contact Center. Examples of ways we have made it more convenient to do business with us include installing digital signature pads, introducing Financial Health insights to our mobile app, expanding video banking, enhancing our self-service digital banking
BECU also opened two new Neighborhood Financial Centers (NFC) in Shoreline and Gig Harbor, and as of the penning of this letter, we have opened locations in Tacoma, White Center, Spokane (South Hill), and will open new NFCs in Kirkland and Stanwood the second half of 2025. We are incredibly excited about how our investment in these neighborhoods not only makes our communities stronger, but also helps make sure that financial resources are available to everyone.
As a member-owned cooperative, we measure our success by how much money we return to each credit union member. This happens through lower lending rates, higher deposit rates and fewer fees compared to bank averages. Last year, BECU returned over $490 million in total to our members. That is an average of $329 per member!
We also deepened our community impact by granting nearly $9.2 million to hundreds of nonprofits and served over 15,000 people through our free Financial Health programs and classes last year. This includes investing in programs and education that reinforce all aspects of financial health and help build resilient and vibrant communities.
Our 3,200 employees are committed through day-to-day digital, in person or phone interactions to assist members in their financial journey. Here is how we helped in 2024:
. 1.5 million+ NFC in-person and Video Banking interactions
. 3.2 million+ Emails, phone calls and messenger chats
. 12.5 million ATM transactions at a BECU ATM
. 62.4 million BECU.org Online Banking logins
We recognize that the world can feel chaotic and unsteady at times. No matter what the future holds, BECU remains solid financially and steadfast in our commitment to serving you - our members - and the communities you call home for generations to come. However you engage with us, face-to-face or digitally, our goal is that you feel like BECU is there for you.
Thank you for being a member and for the trust you place in us.
Debra Somberg, Chair, BECU Board of Directors
Beverly Anderson, President & Chief Executive Officer

BECU + YOU
As a member-owned, not-for-profit cooperative, we provide tools and resources to support your financial well-being and help you build multi-generational wealth. We always look for new ways to offer our members more value and invest in their financial future.
The Facts of Your Financial Institution
If you're new to the BECU family, welcome! We're happy you're here.
You're among the more than 120,000 members who joined the cooperative in 2024. Our total membership has grown by 4% since 2023, reaching over 1.5 million members.
And more than 25,000 of you became members with just a few clicks. Digital signups climbed by nearly 20% compared to 2023 fueled by the launch of our new online account forms for youth and joint accounts to make joining easier.
More small businesses serving our local communities also joined BECU. We welcomed over 9,000 new business members and we now serve nearly 85,000 business members total, up 7.1% since the previous year.

The Cooperative Spirit is Strong
Mindfully managing our expenses is critical to our commitment to supporting your financial goals and growth. That's why we take our net worth ratio seriously - it measures our financial strength in terms of how well-capitalized we are and protects the cooperative against unforeseen or unusual losses. We hit a very strong 11.84% net worth ratio in 2024 (a credit union considered "well-capitalized" has a net worth ratio over 7%).
Our total assets for the year were $29.4 billion, down 1.7% from the previous year.
Deposits - your checking, savings, and CD deposits - totaled $25.1 billion, up 1.2% from 2023. :unselected:
Our loan portfolio was up 5.9% from 2023, totaling $19.7 billion. These loans cover borrowing needs for a variety of meaningful moments, such as buying a home or car, paying for college tuition or purchasing small business equipment.

Returned to Members
As a credit union and financial cooperative, BECU doesn't funnel our profits to shareholders. Instead, we measure our success by how much money we return to each credit union member through lower lending rates, higher deposit rates and fewer fees compared to bank averages.
In 2024, we returned $491.6 million in total to our members - an average of $329 per member (up 5.4% from 2023). Here are two examples of our return to members programs: :selected:
When your credit score improves, our Reprice Program automatically reduces the interest rate on eligible BECU loans or credit cards. Our Reprice Program saved nearly 46,000 members an estimated $2.4 million last year.
First-time homebuyer members received more than $2.25 million granted toward more than 543 mortgages. With our First-Time Homebuyer Grant program, eligible members receive up to $8,000 from BECU to put towards a down payment or closing costs and contribute as little as 1% down from their own funds. Since the launch of the First-Time Homebuyer Grant Program in 2018, BECU has provided over $11.5 million dollars in grant funds helping 1,690 members be able to purchase their first home.
"We're in it to help our members achieve financial freedom for themselves, their families and future generations to come."

Shined in Member Service
Whether you visited us in person at one of our Neighborhood Financial Centers (NFCs), interacted with us digitally or contacted us by phone, we were excited to assist you in your financial journey. Here are the many ways you counted on us in 2024.

"I've been a member since I was a teenager. I've always had a great experience, whether it be electronic or in person."
Christine S., BECU Member
We measure member experience using Net Promoter Scores (NPS) to ensure our members are satisfied and to understand ways we can continue to improve and better serve your needs. In the financial service industry, a score of 50 or more is considered excellent.
To gather these scores, we asked BECU members, "How likely is it that you would recommend us to a friend, family member or colleague?"
In 2024, we earned an average NPS of 66.99, a 7.5% increase from 2023 and our highest NPS since 2021.
Served You Better in Person
Across our NFCs, we are always looking at ways to meet and exceed your needs for access, convenience and personalization. As one example, last year, we installed digital signature pads to eliminate physical sheets of paper and reduce the time needed to complete transactions, saving an estimated 2.5 million pieces of paper in 2024 alone.
We opened two new locations, investing in our local communities. If you're in Shoreline, stop by our new Ballinger NFC for drive-up ATM service, notary services, debit card printing, direct access to Video Banking, business memberships and more. And check out our Gig Harbor NFC for check cashing, cash advances, Coinstar access and teller services and Home-Equity signings, as well as a community space for educational seminars on business services and financial health.

We also refreshed three NFCs, including interior updates and spatial improvements for members to make the experience more modern and convenient, and replaced nearly 40 ATMs throughout our service areas.
In 2024, we announced an upcoming refresh of our Everett Financial Center to improve the member experience; this will include significant investment to upgrade the interior look, improve the feel and function of the space and increase community connection through financial education classes and more. We're also adding new BECU locations in 2025, including NFC locations in Tacoma, White Center, Spokane South Hill, Kirkland and Stanwood.

Prawin Anthony and his wife, Maria, moved to the U.S. in June 2022 after fleeing war in Ukraine. After banking in five countries, he joined BECU.
"The employees here really make you feel like they care about you," he says. NFC employees helped the couple open a BECU account and taught them how credit works in the U.S., offering patience throughout.

At World Relief, an organization resettling refugees and immigrants in Western Washington, Prawin works as a financial empowerment specialist. Prawin realized an alignment with BECU's purpose as a community-oriented organization and an opportunity that couldn't be missed.
"For a lot of our refugee and immigrant community here, one of the biggest challenges is access to accurate information about the financial system," Prawin says.
Prawin asked Steve R., BECU's Federal Way NFC Manager, if BECU could teach a credit class at World Relief. Since then, more than 120 people have taken BECU's classes on understanding credit reports, fraud detection and prevention and Banking 101. BECU also set up pop-up sites at World Relief resource fairs and helped 25 refugees and immigrants open BECU accounts.
"BECU being there, being that partner to support the work we do, it's really impacted the lives of people we serve," Prawin says.
Improved Member Benefits
At BECU, we're constantly working behind the scenes to improve products, services, tools and resources to help members improve their financial health.
Personalized Financial Health Checks
Did you know BECU members get exclusive one-on-one access to a certified financial coach to help you achieve your financial goals?
That might involve building a personalized budget and crafting a workable savings plan, improving your credit standing or setting up a plan to pay down your credit card debt.
TAKE ACTION: You can join the nearly 1,000 members that had a free, confidential phone or video Financial Health Check in 2024 and schedule your 45-55 minutes long appointment in just a few clicks.

GreenPath Helps Members Tackle Debt
In 2024, BECU members enjoyed free, exclusive access to programs from GreenPath, a national nonprofit providing financial counseling services.
GreenPath. financial wellness
GreenPath's menu of services includes debt counseling and management service to help people lead financially healthier lives. In 2024, BECU's partnership led to over 3,500 members receiving financial counseling, and those who enrolled in their debt management program paid down an astounding $6.4 million in debt.
Digital Debit Card Management
By the end of 2024, nearly 40,000 BECU members were using our new self-serve debit card features monthly to:
Â· Set or change their PIN
Â· Request a replacement debit card
. Pause their debit or ATM card
Â· Set a travel notification
. Activate a new debit or ATM card
. See their daily debit and ATM transaction limits
. Enroll in Save-Up Automated Savings
New BECU Mobile App Features
Sleek new modes for the BECU app give you options. Nearly 51,000 members switched their app to Dark Mode, which reduces eye strain, while another 17,000 members chose to Bank "like a 12" with the new Seahawks Theme.
Members also love the BECU app's new Financial Health Insights, which help improve financial health through new insights:

Faster Access
We're all short on time these days. To better serve members, we improved online account enrollment, chat tech support and the speed and security of connecting your BECU account to an external account, as part of our focus to enhance our self-serve options and improve your convenience.
TAKE ACTION: It's never too early to start learning about money - or earning a premium interest rate on the first $500 deposited. Our new Early Saver online membership application eliminated the need to fill out a paper form at an NFC. You can enroll your young family member right from home.
We improved our member support chat features, allowing members to continue their BECU.org chat conversation later without restarting the chat, reducing wait times by an average of 16 minutes.
Finally, linking your BECU account to an external account once took three days; now, it takes just three seconds. Our new multi-factor authentication for external transfer deposits can verify accounts in real time and decreases fraud risk.

BECU and our members participated in season two of the PBS reality TV show Opportunity Knock$. The program tells the stories of credit union members working their way through financial challenges by leveraging credit unions and nonprofits as pathways to improve their financial wellbeing.
OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS
The platform allows audiences to see themselves in the stories presented with an underlying message that credit unions are a source of support and living out the industry theme of "people helping people."
In the segment BECU is featured in, we were able to consolidate several high-interest payday loans that were keeping our members from their dream of homeownership. By working with the family, we freed up over $1,650 per month that made their payments more manageable.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is about ensuring every member feels valued and receives the best experience. We strive to meet the diverse needs of everyone who walks through our doors.

BECU blog, social media channels, member newsletter and BECU.org.

We also expanded our partnership with the Intentionalist through the Equity in Action: It's On Us Initiative, inviting members and employees to "try a treat on BECU" at select participating small businesses that reflect the rich diversity of our communities. In 2024 we featured over 60 businesses owned by individuals from historically underrepresented and marginalized groups.

University of Washington (UW) Partnership
As a UW partner for over 15 years, we're creating a cross- collaborative ecosystem. Students and alumni thrive with access to BECU's competitive rates via more than 249,000 branded debit and credit cards. In turn, the community benefits through our support of student entrepreneurs and programs such as the Foster School of Business scholarship fund.

Washington State University (WSU) Partnership
WSU Alumni and students carry more than 52,000 WSU-branded BECU debit cards and 11,000 credit cards in their wallets, using them to score deals and enjoy great interest rates on credit purchases.
Our partnership with WSU includes so many notable opportunities that it's hard to highlight just a few. We sponsor the WSU Week of Welcome in Pullman, Everett, Spokane and Vancouver.

In difficult situations, our BECU Member Assistance Team supports members facing financial hardships from income loss, whether due to strikes or layoffs.
During the 2024 Boeing machinists strike, we funded more than 900 new loans, totaling $25.9 million, including over 300 personal loans to help members through the strike period as they struggled to make typical payments on bills, cars and mortgages.
Member help also includes budgeting action plans, credit counseling and short-term relief, such as deferred or reduced payments on credit cards and consumer loans. For some loan types, the payment schedule can be recalculated and extended.
During the strike in 2024, Boeing employees could extend their first personal loan payment to 60 days from the standard 45 days. We also modified more than 3,000 loans.
In addition, BECU's Member Assistance Team completed more than 6,500 loan modifications for other members last year as part of our commitment to help.
Advocated for You
BECU advocated for credit union policies to better serve members and communities at the local, state and federal government levels.
Our government relations team worked to improve credit union public policies to ensure better services impacting our members. Important topics included:
Â· Kept the credit union difference intact: BECU, like other not- for-profit financial cooperatives, is exempt from Washington state business and occupation tax as well as federal income tax. This allows BECU to return more benefits to members in the form of great rates and few fees.
Â· Protected fraud prevention investments: BECU advocated to keep our ability to invest in fraud protection and prevention services whole, as well as protect small businesses from increased volatility with card transactions.
Â· Supported a national privacy standard: Protecting our members' data is critical to financial health and stability. We supported legislation that creates a nationwide standard to ensure all entities who touch consumer information be held to the same rules as regulated financial institutions.
Â· Helped create financial literacy awareness: BECU supports our members' financial health journey by providing free financial health services. We supported legislation that creates financial literacy curricula in our school systems to help Washington state youth prepare for financial success.
Scaled Business Member Success
Our nearly 85,000 BECU member businesses are integral parts of our communities - constructing affordable housing, hiring local employees, expanding services designed for you and feeding communities.
BECU is your dedicated financial partner, offering competitive rates and fees and financial services, whether you're a small business or nonprofit. We offer financial health options for businesses and support to entrepreneurs in economically marginalized communities through Business Impact Northwest. We also partner closely with regional affordable housing organizations to better serve our members and their communities.
Affordable Housing
BECU established its Affordable Housing Loan Program in 2019 to focus on preserving existing units through refinancing maturing low- income housing tax credit loans, offering cash out for rehab lending and new workforce housing construction.
To date, BECU has financed $200 million and more than 2,100 affordable housing units throughout Washington state. In addition to standard loan offerings, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), BECU Members are eligible to apply for FHLB Affordable Housing Grants.
Business Ed 101
BECU financial educators offer business owners the education to start or scale your business. In our seminars, our team responds to business members' questions and offers topical advice on loan preparedness and understanding business financial statements.
In 2024, our five free educational business seminars/webinars included:
Â· Building Strong Business Credit
Â· Understanding Business Financial Documents
Â· Managing Cash Flow for Business Success
Â· Key Considerations for Loan Preparedness
Â· How to Make Strategic Business Financial Decisions
Business Impact Northwest
We teamed up with local nonprofit Business Impact NW, which provides financial and technical support to entrepreneurs in economically marginalized communities without access to financial services.
BusinessImpactNW
Business Impact NW offers in-person and webinar-based training, business needs counseling and accounting and marketing referral services.
Between 2022 and 2024, our Business Impact NW scholarship program committed $100,000 to BIPOC, woman and veteran-owned businesses.
Qualifying member businesses can take multi-week courses focused on topics like business plan design or strategic business growth with a mentor's input. Scholarships from BECU cover enrollment costs after course completion.
TAKE ACTION: Learn more about the scholarships and enroll.

The nonprofit GoodRoots Northwest serves over 250,000 individuals annually across East Pierce County to decrease hunger.

The organization wanted to purchase from local farmers, yet federal grants release funds 30-to-60 days after a transaction. Farmers couldn't wait that long for payment.
GoodRoots Northwest CEO Stacey Crnich needed business financing - and fast. She turned to BECU.
Working with the BECU Business Relationship team, Crnich opened a BECU business credit card. It allowed her to pay farmers monthly for produce, sustain operations while waiting for government grant monies and establish a business credit history for GoodRoots Northwest.

A new BECU operating line of credit supported construction of a brick-and-mortar GoodRoots Market. Volunteers act as cashiers, and members pay using a Market Card, designed to look like a credit card to reduce the stigma some children can feel.
"Something simple like a little piece of plastic can change how a young person feels about themselves," Crnich explains.
Another investment - refrigerated lockers - allowed busy customers to pick up free and purchased food after checking real- time inventory and shopping using a smartphone app or computer. With a 2024 BECU equipment line of credit, GoodRoots Northwest plans to deploy more lockers, expanding the organization's reach across Pierce County from 200 to 500 square miles.

BECU + COMMUNITY
We're in the business of people helping people. We are committed to supporting the financial well-being of our members and communities through financial education, coaching and counseling programs and philanthropic funding. We're creating financially resilient communities and empowering underserved populations. Here's how.
Enabled Better Financial Health
Every year, we serve thousands of people through our financial health programs designed to boost savings and investments and increase financial confidence and capability. BECU's financial health team delivers services over the phone, through video banking, as well as out in the community, at our Neighborhood Financial Centers and in classrooms throughout the year - virtually and in-person.
We served over 15,000 people through our Financial Health programs, including more than 5,000 BECU members and non- members who attended a seminar, webinar or Financial Reality Fair.
Financial Reality Fairs are immersive simulation experiences for teens. There, teens experience budgeting, saving and spending (and maybe even a bit of overspending) as if working with adult limitations and budgets.
But you don't have to be a student (or even a BECU member) to attend our free seminars and webinars, which cover topics ranging from budgeting to trust and estate planning.
TAKE ACTION: Get Money Smart(er). Watch a BECU webinar from home 24/7 or attend a free in-person seminar at one of our locations to learn about topics such as Understanding Credit Reports and Scores, Financing Your Home and Fraud Detection and Prevention.
Gamifying Finances with Zogo
Have you met Zogo? It's a fun app with online games members can use to learn more about money. Perhaps you're one of our 6,000 members who've completed 90,000+ learning modules.

Our Work, Our Communities
We are enthusiastic about how and why we fund various projects in the communities BECU serves. Here are just a few of the standout successes.
Community Care
Founded by Seattle Seahawks football player Doug Baldwin Jr., the Family First Community Center in Renton opened its doors in 2024 and serves 160 visitors daily. Growing up in Pensacola, Florida, Doug loved hanging out at his local community center, which acted as a second home for kids in the community.

"When I got older, I realized how impactful that place was for me and how much kids need spaces like that."
Doug Baldwin Jr.
Doug was inspired to create the Renton center after learning that the Seattle suburb lacked a gym and affordable health clinic. In addition, more than a third of all Renton residents lived in poverty, including a quarter of kids under 18.
Now, the facility is Washington's first community center with an on- site health clinic with medical, dental and behavioral health services. BECU is proud to support the Family First Community Center with funding and other resources.
Market Wisdom
In Spokane, the Scale House Market at the Quarry is housed in a building that formerly measured truck loads. Opening in spring 2025, the market will offer a delicious oasis in an area designated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a "food desert."
The SCALE HOUSE MARKET AT THE QUARRY
BECU joins community members at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Scale House Market
The market will provide a dedicated space for local farmers, small businesses and community members with a consistent space to sell their products. Shoppers can load up totes with farm-fresh produce at the year-round, indoor-outdoor market in Spokane's newest hub for food-centric learning and access. Classes and events in the center's learning kitchen will teach long-lost culinary skills still useful today.
With BECU's multi-year sponsorship, the Spokane Conservation District broke ground on the market in fall 2024 with plans to open to the public in spring 2025. Scale House Market is expected to attract 249,000 visitors annually and support over 65 local farms and businesses. Our support will help fund programming, such as helping small business vendors test products, refine techniques and develop innovative business practices.
Bumping Up Biz Skills
In 2024, BECU sponsored the Success Foundation's first-ever Southside Leadership Conference at Highline College in Des Moines, Washington. At the conference, emerging professionals networked and attended sessions led by industry experts, gaining essential skills and strategic insights for success.
Success Foundation
At the Foundation's Workforce Discovery Lab's five-day summer 2024 workshop, Highline and Tukwila students earned $500 in cash while they brushed up on professional skills and explored career pathways. Local businesses partnered to offer developmental opportunities, helping to bridge the education-workforce gap.
Food for Thought
BECU funded grads-to-be through the Tacoma Community College Foundation. The foundation has awarded almost 3,000 scholarships, helping students earn technical certificates or complete associate degrees. With these credentials, students advance professionally, succeed in a new career or pursue undergraduate studies at a college or university.
T TACOMA COMMUNITY COLLEGE
We fund this vital work in addition to the Max and Margi Harned Titan Food Pantry, which provides food and personal care items to alleviate student poverty.
Continued Our Community Equity Commitment
In 2024, BECU's Black Community Development Project awarded $1 million to nonprofits, culminating a five-year, $5 million commitment to improving the overall financial health and well- being of the Black community.
Nonprofits supported through the Black Community Development Project are focused on improving the financial, emotional, physical and financial health and well-being of the Black community. While these organizations are led by and serve the Black community, the impact of their work is felt throughout the broader community.
The Black Community Development Project includes nonprofit capacity building grants that activate a nonprofit's organization and leadership skills, resources and competencies. With this funding the organization's next level of success becomes a little easier to achieve. This year, we awarded $150,000 to seven grassroots organizations nominated by BECU members through the People Helping People Awards process.

In 2024, the BECU Foundation continued its partnership with the Washington State Opportunity Scholarship (WSOS) to encourage students along the graduation path. The partnership has reached an incredible milestone - investing a total of $1.2 million in student scholarships. Over the last six years, these funds have been matched with state funding, which has enabled $2.3 million to be awarded to more than 150 Opportunity Scholars.
WASHINGTON STATE OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP
In addition to financial aid, BECU offers mentorship opportunities and career training to holistically support Opportunity Scholars as they build their pathway to a career. WSOS supports Washington students in high-demand trade, health care and STEM occupations with two scholarship options:
Baccalaureate Scholarships
For those pursuing a bachelor's degree, the BECU Foundation supported six scholarships. The scholarship ensures that a student can continue to receive funding of up to $22,500 annually in financial aid support, which can be used at any eligible Washington college or university. Baccalaureate Scholarships run from freshman year through the fifth year or graduation from college, whichever is sooner.
Career and Technical Scholarships
The BECU Foundation supported 11 of these scholarships, providing up to $10,000 annually for the duration of an associate degree, certificate or apprenticeship program at any of Washington state's 35 community and technical colleges. Scholars can qualify for Career and Technical Scholarships for four years or program completion, whichever is sooner.
Helped with Homes
To help combat hardships contributing to homelessness, we continued our partnership with the eight local nonprofits who received Housing Stability Grants in 2023. Nonprofits direct funds toward preventing eviction and housing loss by assisting with home repairs, providing housing counseling, offering landlord-tenant mediation and other services.
These organizations include Multi-Service Center, Rebuilding Together South Sound, Solid Ground, El Centro de la Raza, SNAP Financial Access, King County Bar Association, Byrd Barr Place and Northwest Justice Project.

The organization will break ground on new developments in Beacon Hill in 2025 and Mt. Baker in 2026.
The new development offers 43 programs and services, including financial empowerment through a first-time home-buying program, homelessness prevention, rental counseling and foreclosure prevention.
SNAP Financial Access
SNAP Financial Access is as an organization that "sees opportunity where others do not." The Spokane-based nonprofit has served almost 1,000 clients in reaching for and achieving financial stability and success.
SNAP FINANCIAL ACCESS
Families and individuals can access a wide range of housing aid, including home-buying counseling, first-home down payment assistance, home repair programs and home foreclosure prevention programs, including mortgage payment assistance.

The community land trust ecoTHRIVE Housing is developing an innovative pilot project opening in 2025. The village includes 27 beautiful ecoCottages in Burien, Washington that residents co-own through a cooperative as an alternative to renting.
These climate-adaptive, low-carbon use homes are integrated into single-family neighborhoods, offering "gentle density." The cottages also provide a path to ownership and an alternative to renting.
Spotlight: Emerald Cities Collaborative
Emerald Cities Collaborative (ECC) is expanding its E-Contractor Academy, a seven-week training program for underrepresented contractors to expand their businesses through clean energy projects. As demand grows for decarbonation, the goal is to develop a deep pool of skillful contractors who can compete, lead and succeed in the green infrastructure sector.
The expansion will include the development of an E-Contractor Network, which will add ongoing support, small business grants, industry and topic-specific workshops. This will also allow those who cannot attend an E-Contractor Academy the opportunity to benefit from the support, training and connections that ECC can offer.

Engaged the Credit Union Community
At BECU, we're deeply rooted in the credit union movement and the cooperative, member-centric approach to business. And in true cooperative spirit, credit unions often come together to support one another and educate consumers on the benefits of belonging to a credit union.
BECU supports local and national credit union trade associations and foundations in a variety of ways, including memberships, board roles, leading and participating in educational programs, fundraising, providing grants and more.
Here are a few highlights of our giving in the credit union community:
National Credit Union Foundation
BECU provided an annual donation to support credit union development initiatives at the National Credit Union Foundation. In 2024, in response to hurricane relief efforts, we also donated to support the CUAid Fund. This fund helps credit union employees and volunteers rebuild after natural disasters strike, so they can better serve members who are also struggling.
THE
National Credit Union FOUNDATION'
Cooperative Trust
We supported Cooperative Trust's Crasher program at the Government Affairs Conference through Filene. The program connects young and emerging credit union talent with industry leadership at the conference, an annual gathering of credit unions in Washington, D.C. These young leaders demonstrate exceptional dedication to the credit union movement and the program deepens their commitment to the credit union mission.
Filene
GoWest Foundation
The GoWest Foundation works with credit unions and community partners to provide solutions for the financial health of the people and communities served in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming. To further these efforts, we support credit union projects on various initiatives, including:
Â· Financial reality fair kits to promote youth financial capability
Â· Workforce housing grants
Â· Professional development opportunities for a strong bench of credit union leadership
GOWEST FOUNDATION
"It's always inspiring to see the positive impact credit unions like BECU have on their communities - an important reflection of the cooperative spirit we champion at GoWest."
Nayab A., GoWest Credit Union Association
Supporting Equity through Credit Union Partnerships
African-American Credit Union Coalition
For the last four years, BECU has partnered with the African- American Credit Union Coalition (AACUC), supporting their efforts to strengthen diversity, equity and inclusion in the credit union industry with a focus on Black-identifying individuals. In addition to providing funding, BECU employees participate in AACUC programming and have helped develop a model for large credit unions to reach and partner with diverse communities.
AACUC AFRICAN-AMERICAN CREDIT UNION COALITION
National Association of Latino Credit Unions & Professionals
In 2024, BECU entered a five-year partnership with the National Association of Latino Credit Unions & Professionals, dedicated to providing financial education and services for the Hispanic/Latino community. The organization also focuses on increasing economic, asset-building and professional development opportunities, including honoring a Latinx Credit Union Professional of the Month.
NLOUP National Association of Latino Credit Unions & Professionals
Our support includes funding, as well as offering BECU employees to speak as part of NLCUP's monthly webinar series. A delegation of 12 BECU employees also attended the organization's annual conference.
"The passion and dedication shared by everyone at the conference were truly inspiring, as we came together with a common goal: to make a meaningful difference through purpose-driven work."
Siena P., BECU Employee
CU Pride
BECU is proud to have become the first credit union noted as CU Pride's "Pioneer Ally." We committed to five years of annual donations to CU Pride, the association dedicated to promoting LGBTQ+ credit union professionals, members and allies while providing opportunities for education, engagement, sharing and celebration.
CUPRIDE LERTO- ASSOCIATION FOR CREDIT UNIONS
Beyond funding, we offer speakers for numerous events throughout the year - including CU Pride's annual conference and their Allies into Action webinar series.
In 2024, we worked with CU Pride to develop the first ERG Xchange for employee resource groups for three large credit unions, including BECU. The event's education, networking and collaborative conversations were wildly successful. In the future, CU Pride plans to expand this event and programming to all CU Pride member organizations' employee resource groups.
Supporting the Broader Cooperative Movement
In addition to engaging fellow credit unions, BECU also supports efforts to connect cooperatives more broadly across various industries. This support includes membership and board service with the following organizations:
National Cooperative Business Association
The National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA) works to build a better world and a more inclusive economy that empowers people to contribute to shared prosperity and well-being for themselves and future generations. By leveraging the shared resources of the cooperative movement, NCBA seeks to engage, partner with and empower people from all walks of life - particularly those left behind by a shifting economy and facing the greatest economic and societal barriers.
NGBA CLUSA
Northwest Cooperative Development Center
The Northwest Cooperative Development Center (NWCDC) is dedicated to assisting new and existing cooperative businesses in every sector across Washington, Oregon and Idaho. NWCDC has a special focus on Resident Owned Communities, home care agencies, and worker-owned or community-owned cooperatives.

Generated Green Goals
As BECU works to become a more environmentally sustainable organization, we also look for opportunities to engage our members and partners in this work. Through these efforts we support organizations and events that aim to restore and care for green spaces and inspire collective efforts to help better our planet.
Beyond our Green Equity Initiative Grants through the BECU Foundation, we also support broader community efforts focused on environmental restoration and management. In 2024, BECU donated $7,000 to two environmental nonprofits in Washington state, including Great Peninsula Conservancy in Bremerton, Washington and Environmental Science Center in Burien, Washington.

Spotlight: A Homegrown Culture of Multicultural Leadership
We expect BECU to represent the communities we serve at all levels of the organization from our front lines to the Executive Management Team and Board of Directors.
In 2022, our data review revealed a gap in diversity and representation in director-level roles at BECU. Through a partnership between our Human Resources team and the BECU Office of Equity and Inclusion, we envisioned and launched a new Multicultural Emerging Leaders (MEL) program to address barriers to advancement and nurture diverse talent across the organization.
This program was designed to grow our next generation of leaders from within, offering mentoring and training. Two cohorts completed the program as of April 2024 covering a variety of topics, including:
Â· Foundations of race and culture
Â· Principles of professional growth
Â· Leadership styles
Â· Applying emotional intelligence
The program culminates with a capstone project that presents an organizational opportunity to the Executive Management Team. Because of BECU's ongoing investment in equity and inclusion, we're proud to highlight the increase in diverse representation at the leadership level, including a notable rise in directors and vice presidents from underrepresented groups since the introduction of the MEL program.
MEL program graduates Johan P., Amanious H. and Brittany T.
The work continues as BECU tests, learns and innovates. Our third MEL cohort kicked off in October 2024. In addition to its multicultural approach and learning curriculum, we evolved the development of leadership capabilities - individually and collectively. The program's third iteration asked vice presidents and senior vice presidents to nominate candidates on a career path toward a director role. Program participants then focus on developing skills for their next role and deliver a presentation highlighting their workshop learnings and leadership capabilities to their directors, vice presidents, and senior vice presidents.
Engaged Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)
Our ERGs support our broader inclusion goals by bringing together groups of employees who have common interests and face common issues. ERGs are a way for employees to support each other, build community, share concerns and identify solutions to further BECU's purpose. All employees are welcome to join any of the offered ERGs.
Celebrating Our Collective Impact
BECU ERG Leaders
Through our ten ERGs, employees volunteered, sponsored, tabled and participated in nearly 200 employee and community events throughout 2024. You may have seen us at various Pride Festivals across the state, Junior Achievement events, and the Armed Forces Torchlight Parade at the Spokane Lilac Festival in 2024.
Around 40% of employees are ERG members, and many also contributed their voices to BECU's blog.

Welcomed All to the Equity Summit
EQUITY SUMMIT BECU
We hosted our fourth annual Equity Summit with influential keynote speakers, workshops and nearly 1,000 BECU employees in attendance, in-person and online. Employees also heard from key nonprofit partners.
"Equity Summit = Positivity + Energy + Inclusion + Empowerment + Great Leadership."
Vandana S., BECU Employee
The 2024 Equity Summit's theme was "Empowerment Through Action." While previous summits focused on education and awareness, this year's summit focused on putting diversity, equity and inclusion commitments in play. Six hybrid sessions covered a wide range of topics:
Â· Serving multicultural communities
Â· Sustainable solutions to the affordable housing crisis
Â· Equitable action for sustainability
Â· Operationalizing racial equity
Â· Internal career mobility
Â· Employee resources for their continued diversity, equity and inclusion learning journey
BECU Cares
You're a credit union member because you care, just like our employees. Our BECU Cares program amplifies the impact our employees make in the community by putting funds behind the time and money they contribute to nonprofits nationwide. In 2024, our generous BECU employees donated and volunteered an impressive amount to support our communities.

In 2024, these efforts led to over $485,000 directed to nonprofits on behalf of BECU employee volunteer activities.
Spotlight: Where Employees Gave Money and Time
Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition partners with BECU's Environmental Sustainability and Native Indigenous Peoples ERG on an annual river cleanup near BECU's headquarters. The Seattle- based organization addresses health equity, climate justice, advocacy and stewardship, and youth leadership.
DUWAMISH RIVER COMMUNITY COALITION
TAKE ACTION: Enjoy shaved ice and listen to live music at the summer Duwamish River Festival or catch a boat tour hosted by the Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition. Head to the organization's site to learn more.
A former BECU People Helping People Award winner and long- standing philanthropic partner, Giving Back Spokane provides food, housing and transportation assistance for Spokane-area individuals and families struggling with poverty. Employees were inspired after our Day of Purpose to direct their awards to this organization.
GIVING BACK Spokane
World Central Kitchen is on the frontline of disasters around the world, providing emergency meals to those displaced by conflict and natural events. Employees supported World Central Kitchen in the organization's hurricane recovery and response efforts throughout the year.

Employee Sustainability Efforts
BECU employees drive positive organization-wide environmental, social and economic impacts. Through strategic planning, collaboration and innovation, we're supporting sustainability efforts at BECU and in our communities for the betterment of our shared planet. Here's how.
Employee Eco-Resources
Employees can access sustainability resources, including links to free online courses, book recommendations and free Linkedin Learning Courses available through BECU benefits.
The BECU Sustainability Office worked with BECU's Environmental Sustainability Resource Group (a BECU ERG) on several small projects to boost organization-wide sustainability by:
Â· Creating guides for working sustainably
Â· Hosting events sustainably
Â· Building capacity for green loan products
Fill 'Er Up (with Electricity)
In 2018, BECU worked with ChargePoint to install two Electric Vehicle charging stations with four charging points at our Tukwila Financial Center. In 2024, we added two new EV charging stations. We're loving the difference the charging stations have made since 2018:
Â· Reduced greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 83,000 pounds, equal to planting 963 trees for 10 years
Â· A 75% increase in usage in 2024 over 2023
Â· Supported over 42,200 miles of eco-friendly travel
The success of this program has led the credit union to explore additional sustainability initiatives.
TAKE ACTION: Charge up your car next time you're at the Tukwila branch. Just be mindful of the time limits due the chargers' popularity.
"It's so amazing to be a part of BECU's Environmental Sustainability ERG, finding ways to help our earth while helping our community."

Typically, financial transactions require a lot of paper. To reduce our reliance on paper, BECU employees integrate electronic signatures where possible.
In 2024, we saved 2.5 million sheets of paper, which equates to:
Â· 271 trees
Â· 265,840 gallons of water
Â· 211,919 pounds of CO2
Â· 14,672 pounds of solid waste
Not only is this good for the planet, but going paperless also saved over 10,000 hours of staff and member time so we can spend more time serving you.
TAKE ACTION: Want to do your part? Opt into environmentally friendly eStatements, or paper-free account statements delivered directly to Online Banking or Business Online Banking. eStatements are available for consumer and business savings, checking, CDS, credit card and loans. You can also use online options for forms when available, rather than printing.

2024 Financials
The Audit Committee held six meetings during 2024. The Audit Committee retained the independent public accounting firm of Crowe LLP to perform the audit of BECU's 2024 financial statements. The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed BECU's 2024 audited financial statements with Crowe, the credit union's Chief Audit Executive and management. In carrying out its responsibilities, the Audit Committee believes that appropriate internal controls are in place at BECU and that the 2024 financial statements accurately reflect the strong financial position of the credit union.
