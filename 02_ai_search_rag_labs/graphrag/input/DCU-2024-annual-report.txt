Our Message
At DCU, we are guided by the central credit union philosophy of people helping people, and this year was no different. 2024 was a year for the history books, thanks to the amazing dedication and hard work of all our employees who came together to provide members with exceptional service.
Members Are Our Priority
The work we do goes beyond just numbers and transactions. It's about people and their financial futures. We launched initiatives like Goals-Based Banking and Greenlight to help members manage their financial wellness and boost financial literacy in their families. We also updated our call centers in Massachusetts, Florida, and Georgia, creating a better, more efficient experience for members.
Members are at the top of our mind with every decision we make, whether it's giving back to our communities or developing new products and services. We appreciate them, and they showed us how much they appreciate us, too. Our "problems experienced" metric was at a record low, showing the hard work and dedication of all our teams who work together to serve our members.
With your trust in DCU, we grew deposits by 6.1%-higher than industry averages.
Our Community Impact
In 2024, we made a difference in the lives of our members and within their communities through charitable contributions, sponsorships, and volunteer initiatives. We held our first company-wide Day of Service, in which employees throughout the credit union supported non-profit organizations across Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Georgia, and Florida. Our teams volunteered at food drives, donated blood, packed hygiene kits for local vulnerable communities, and wrote letters to veterans.
DCU 2024 Annual Report | 4
Our team members and our foundations shined. Our DCU for Kids donations totaled $1.8 million and supported 187 organizations, while 80 DCU for Kids Memorial Scholarships were awarded, totaling $150,000.
Axuda, our non-profit organization that provides short-term, interest-free loans to those in need, continued to benefit people in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Our DCU Cares Disaster Recovery Program provided loan assistance for members impacted by Hurricanes Helene, Milton, and Beryl.
New Partnership
In 2024, we announced our intent to combine with First Tech Federal Credit Union through a merger of equals for the benefit of our members, employees, and communities. First Tech is a credit union similar to DCU in values, membership, roots in innovation, and a shared heritage of serving technology employees and families.
Our priority has always been-and remains-our people. This combination is not about becoming a larger organization. It allows two exceptional credit unions to come together and provide members with an unrivaled digital experience, a coast-to-coast branch network with expanded member service hours, and access to premier financial products, services, and advisors.
This is an exciting time in our journey, and while we have seen tremendous growth and change, one thing will always remain the same-our unwavering commitment to making a positive difference in the lives of our members and employees.
No matter the changes we go through, we will always focus on our core principles that have endured since our founding 45 years ago in 1979:
People Come First
Do the Right Thing
Make a Difference
Thank you for your loyalty and for entrusting us with your financial well-being.

DCU for Kids
DCU for Kids was founded in 2005 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit with a simple mission: to improve the quality of life for children in need. To date, we've donated almost $30 million to support causes like education, enrichment programs, medical research, support services, and student scholarships. Our giving initiatives center around four pillars: Youth Community Programs, Insecure Population Basic Need Support, Special Needs Support, and Medical/Health & Well-being Support.

Day of Service
In October, we held our first company-wide Day of Service, supporting non-profit organizations across Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Georgia, and Florida. Over 300 of our team members-spanning our employee footprint-dedicated their time both in person and virtually to give back to our local communities. Keep reading to learn about the highlights of the day.
Food Drive - We collected, sorted, and packed over 300 pounds of food to donate to local food banks. We collected enough food that would sustain one family of four for about 100 days or 100 families for three days.
Hygiene Kitting - We packed over 600 hygiene kits to help people experiencing homelessness stay healthy by partnering with Massachusetts-based organizations New Vue, Advocates, NorthStar Family Services, Alternative House, and New Hampshire-based Families in Transition.
Letters to Veterans - We wrote and sent 20 letters to veterans and active military members in partnership with the organization A Million Thanks. Veterans and active military members experience isolation and loneliness at a higher rate in our society, especially those who are thousands of miles from home. Sending letters of support and gratitude can make these soldiers feel like they have family everywhere, sparking joy when it is needed the most.
Pillowcase Decorating - We used our creative minds and artistic skills to decorate more than 60 pillowcases for children. These pillowcases were given to organizations that support the well-being of vulnerable families and children, including Family Promise Metrowest in Natick, MA, Harbor Care in Nashua, NH, and Lazarus House and Family Services of Merrimack Valley in Lawrence, MA.
Blood Drives - Partnering with the American Red Cross and the Kraft Family Blood Donor Center, we held blood drives at our Marlborough and Chelmsford offices. Collectively, we donated nearly 70 units of blood. Every day, area hospitals require 36 units of blood to sustain their patients' needs. This means that DCU employees donated almost two days' worth of life-sustaining blood.
Off-site Activities - We also volunteered our time at six off-site locations to participate in outside service activities: Bread and Roses (Lawrence, MA), Boys & Girls Club of Central GA (Macon, GA), Boys & Girls Club of Greater Lowell (Lowell, MA), Boys & Girls Club of Greater Worcester (Worcester, MA), Feeding Northeast Florida (Jacksonville, FL), and Southern Middlesex Opportunity Council (Framingham, MA).

Member-Centered Outlook
People helping people is at the core of everything we do. With every new product we develop or service we implement, our members are always at the forefront of our minds. In 2024, we enhanced and introduced products and services that would directly improve members' experiences.
Contact Center Modernization
Our contact center modernization was a cross-collaborative initiative that optimized experiences for both employees and members. These updates improved workforce management-making scheduling more efficient-and enhanced our quality monitoring process. This upgrade also introduced the Interactive Virtual Agent, which gave members more self-service capabilities and improved call routing to ensure members are connected with the most appropriate agent.
Worcester Gold Star Branch Relocation
We relocated our Worcester Gold Star branch to a new spot in the same plaza. The new location features a drive-up teller window and four ATMs to better serve members. Members have shared their appreciation for the new spot by highlighting the branch's bright appearance, great parking, and overall convenience.
Financial Education Seminars
The importance of financial education should not be underestimated. When members are equipped with proper financial education, they can make smart, confident decisions about their money. Leaders in our Member Services department organized and led a series of financial education seminars focused on topics like understanding credit scores, debt management, and effective budgeting. Attendees of these seminars included members from Select Employee Groups, community organizations, and local colleges. This initiative not only supported personal financial growth, but it also fostered a stronger, more financially aware community.
"The seminar was incredibly informative and eye-opening. I learned so much about managing my credit and budgeting effectively. I feel much more confident about my financial future now."

DCU Center Partnership

DCU Cares
In October, we unveiled the DCU Connect Lounge at the DCU Center. This newly designed space reimagines the existing Showcase Overlook area, transforming it into a guest-centric lounge for passive use by attendees of events, tradeshows, conferences, and more. The lounge combines work-friendly amenities with comfortable seating, providing a relaxing environment for guests to unwind or catch up on work.
We introduced exclusive member perks at the DCU Center, allowing members to skip the line at arena events by using the dedicated DCU Member Entrance. Members also had the chance to be randomly selected for seat upgrades, receive concession vouchers, gain early access to presale tickets, and enjoy discounts for concerts and sporting events.
Willow TV
We proudly partnered with Willow TV, the premier broadcaster of cricket in the United States and Canada-sponsoring broadcasts of the highly popular ICC T20 format cricket games, including the Indian Premier League (IPL). Cricket's reach is growing across the country and is the second most watched sport globally, with a passionate fan base. Through this sponsorship, we were able to deepen our connection with DCU members who enjoy cricket, sharing live match TV and digital video spots, and hosting watch parties led by employee cricket experts. In addition, DCU employees who are cricket players led educational sessions during India Night at Polar Park in Worcester. The Willow partnership strengthened our relationship with our members-82% of members surveyed said that seeing DCU sponsor cricket games made them feel prouder to be a member.

Our Growing Enterprise
2024 was a year of growth, in terms of finances and footprint. Financial growth helps us better serve members and their ever-changing needs, while expanding our footprint helps us welcome more people to the DCU family.
Commercial Lending
The Boston Business Journal named us the credit union in Massachusetts with the fastest growing commercial loan portfolio. Despite strong market challenges in 2024, the efforts from our Commercial Lending team resulted in positive portfolio growth of $88.2 million. A focus on business deposits led to a 22% increase in balances from members with a commercial lending relationship. These successes would not have been possible without our strong business member relationships, new certificate accounts, money market initiatives, and our team's increased focus on management procedures and controls.
Deposits
Our total deposit growth in 2024 was 6.1%, or $634 million. This growth was driven by significant increases in Advantage Savings and short-term certificate accounts, largely due to our competitive rate offerings and the efforts of our incredibly talented deposit-gathering teams.
Mortgages
We increased our home equity guidelines to allow members to borrow more of the equity in their homes. DCU can now lend up to 90% combined loan-to-value for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC) in most states. In 2024, we helped more than 4,000 members with mortgage and home equity loans, totaling over $643 million.
Awards & Recognitions
As we strive to make a positive impact on our communities, they recognize us in return. We are honored to have received the following accolades in 2024:
. The Worcester Business Journal (WBJ) named us the Best Credit Union in Central Massachusetts, praising our local and national footprint.
. Forbes named us the Best Credit Union in Massachusetts-an award based on member satisfaction, member service, financial advice, fees, and ease of use of services.
. The Boston Business Journal recognized us as the largest credit union in Massachusetts.
. Money.com included us in the 10 Best Auto Refinance Companies of 2024 and recognized us for the Best High-Yield Savings Account.
DCU 2024 Annual Report | 12
. Business Insider named us the Best Credit Union in Massachusetts for the month of May.
. The Women's Edge, in partnership with the Boston Globe, named us as one of the Top 100 Women-Led Businesses in Massachusetts.
Optimizing Financial Experiences
We strive every day to ensure our members are satisfied with their financial experiences. In 2024, we introduced new features and functionalities that give members a seamless banking experience.
Greenlight
In the last quarter of 2024, we partnered with Greenlight-an innovative platform that includes a debit card for kids and an app-and successfully launched a cutting-edge financial education and management tool for our members. This platform not only comes at no cost to our members but also empowers families to raise financially savvy children through features like budgeting tools, savings goals, and real-time spending tracking. The response from our members was overwhelmingly positive, with Greenlight registrations surpassing forecast numbers in the first few weeks following the launch. Today, over 11,000 members, including more than 6,000 children, are benefiting from Greenlight's financial education resources, thanks to DCU. These successes spotlight the strong demand for tools that foster financial literacy in our communities and enforce our commitment and vision to equip DCU members with tools to achieve long-term financial success.
DCU Visa® Signature Cash Rewards Credit Card
We introduced a new and improved credit card-the Visa® Signature Cash Rewards Credit Card-that offers cardholders 1% cashback, an updated rewards website, and merchant-funded offers. The card features a new design and contactless chip technology, allowing members to simply tap their card to make purchases and adding another layer of security. Visa® Rewards cardholders were also newly able to redeem their points for cash, deposited directly into their DCU account, as opposed to previously only being able to redeem their points for gift cards.
Goals-Based Banking
We launched a new Digital Banking feature in 2024 to help members on their saving journeys. Goals-Based Banking is designed to empower members to achieve their dreams by saving for specific goals, such as a new car, college education, first home, or an emergency fund. This feature offers flexible savings options and personalized strategies to help members make the most of every dollar. Using our Goals-Based Banking capability, members have set more than 143,000 goals and collectively saved nearly $380 million towards achieving their goals.
DCU 2024 Annual Report | 13
Fighting Fraud
Reducing and preventing fraud remained a top priority for us in 2024-and will continue to be in 2025 and beyond. We are committed to keeping our members' accounts, information, and money safe and secure. We welcomed new advancements and updates and increased our fraud awareness messaging to strengthen our fight against fraud. This helped us end the year with significantly lower levels of fraud and losses.
DCU Fraud Committee
Collaboration is an integral part of DCU culture. Something as complex as fraud often requires many teams to put their heads together. The DCU Fraud Committee was established through teams across the credit union uniting to strengthen fraud prevention controls in various areas, such as consumer loans, account openings, and digital banking. The committee generated short-term actions to tighten applicant screening and reinforce lending stipulations, while also identifying areas that required long-term efforts. This enterprise-wide committee eventually evolved into a group of leaders across DCU who continue to explore alternative strategies and prioritize resources in our ongoing effort to mitigate fraud risk and the impact it has on our members.
Frontline Fraud Team
We know fraud can be a stressful topic for members, especially when it impacts accounts. Our Information Center created a frontline fraud team, comprised of agents who received additional training and system access. This team provides members with faster resolution of fraud-related issues.
Money Movement Improvements
With fraud controls in place, we were able to launch several improvements to member money movement limits, increasing digital account opening limits and transfer limits. These positive changes resulted in a 300% increase in account opening balances and a significant reduction of 56% fewer members hitting their daily transfer limits-dramatically improving our members' experience.
Fraud Enhancements
We are continuously updating our systems to ensure member information is protected against fraud. For example, we updated our automated clearing house (ACH) hold policies to align with the financial industry and help prevent member fraud. Holding funds for clearance before making them available to members significantly reduced our collective fraud losses.
In 2024, we enhanced the authentication processes for our payments platform to provide an additional layer of security. Moreover, we continue to help educate our members on trending fraud risks, such as account takeover, by routinely extending informational updates and best practices for fraud prevention through digital banking and social media.

Hello
Efficiency is Key
We are always trying to improve our efficiency here at DCU. Streamlining processes and services leads to better experiences for our members. Our Enterprise Strategy team implemented a new program to help departments across the organization upgrade best practices, automate processes, realize cost savings, and improve member experience. Through this program, DCU departments saved over 260,000 hours, giving us more time to focus on members. For example, our Account Services team leveraged automation to increase efficiency in deposit services and new accounts.
DCU 2024 Annual Report | 15
Innovation is in Our DNA
Since our inception as the credit union for Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), innovation has been in our DNA. We are constantly finding new innovations that directly serve our members.
MassChallenge Partnership
In 2024, we were lucky enough to be a community partner to MassChallenge, a startup accelerator based in Boston, Massachusetts. This collaboration helped us further our innovation goals, giving us a glimpse at the emerging technological advancements that fintech startups are bringing to the financial services industry. It also enabled us to connect with several bright fintech innovators.
MC MASSCHALLENGE
We had a front-row seat to learn about the 2024 fintech cohorts and their innovations, which covered a range of areas, from financial education to artificial intelligence. These startups were focused on addressing the trends that shape the finance industry as well as the importance of the human side of innovation.
This partnership also led to opportunities for us to contribute to the conversation around anti-fraud practices. Our Fraud Strategy Manager was invited to speak on a panel hosted by MassChallenge, where he discussed the importance of collaborating with fintech startups and how they can help us improve our fraud prevention efforts.
Our relationship with MassChallenge has given us vital insights into new solutions that will help us improve member experience. We're excited to continue this relationship in 2025 as a Challenge Partner.

Our Employees
The drive and passion that our employees have for ensuring our members have the best experience possible is incredible. Every day, their hard work keeps us operating smoothly. In 2024, we made strides in improving internal processes that were incorporated into all phases of an employee's professional life, including talent acquisition, performance management, and training and development opportunities.
Employee Appreciation Week
We launched this new enterprise-wide tradition to help show our appreciation for our employees and enhance connectivity in a hybrid world. With a new theme each day, employees were encouraged to share photos, answer questions, and participate in activities to get to know their colleagues and enter for a chance to win prizes.
Career Growth & Development
We created new programs to better prepare incoming and newly promoted leaders to effectively manage others. We also launched a competency model and associated behaviors that were incorporated into all phases of the employee lifecycle. We educated leaders and employees through the launch of formal talent review sessions, documentation of succession plans, and the build out of enhanced career laddering across many DCU departments and disciplines.
The Results
We want our employees to feel recognized and appreciated every day when they come to work. Our initiatives in 2024 were no doubt driving factors behind our lower turnover rates and increased engagement scores. Specifically, employee turnover rates, both within the 90 day and one year of hire dates, were down from 2023. Meanwhile, our employee engagement scores increased from 2023, and were the highest they've been in five years, signaling that employees are feeling more connected and valued.

Leadership Development Programs
Effective leadership requires the ability to create inclusive environments where everyone can thrive. Leadership development programs are structured initiatives designed to enhance the skills, capabilities, and behaviors necessary for effective leadership within an organization.
New Employee Orientation
Onboarding and integrating new hires into an organization ensures they understand its culture, values, policies, and procedures. Our orientation program was enhanced with content focused on diversity principles to instill an inclusive mindset from day one.
DCU 2024 Annual Report | 18
Inclusive Insight Series
Inclusive insights are curated micro-learning opportunities that emphasize the value of diversity and inclusion through focused presentations by subject matter experts, facilitated discussions, learning, and engagement activities. The series was revamped to ensure the delivery of focused topics aligned with heritage months, such as "Celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander Culture via Chinese Calligraphy" and "Creating a Disability-Inclusive Workplace via an Introduction to American Sign Language and Deaf Culture."
Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)
Our ERGs played a pivotal role in creating a more inclusive and engaged workplace. In 2024, ERGs launched organization-wide initiatives designed to promote connection, belonging, and active participation for all employees.
. Our Black, Indigenous, and People of Color / African, Latinx, Asian, Arab, and Native American (BIPOC/ALAANA) Connection brought cultural vibrancy to life with a thrilling T20 World Cup Cricket Event, celebrating unity through sport and heritage.
