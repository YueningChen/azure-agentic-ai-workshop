BOARD CHAIR AND CEO MESSAGE
ICCU's mission statement is, "Helping members achieve financial success." Members should feel confident that ICCU is a safe, dependable, and trusted financial institution that provides services and products to meet their diverse financial needs, while ensuring a personalized experience during each interaction. Our commitment to delivering on this mission statement has been unwavering and our efforts have yielded remarkable results across various domains for many years. We are extremely pleased with our progress in financial performance, strategic initiatives, community outreach and engagement, and team member development over the past year.
ICCU was named a Best Places to Work in Idaho for 13 years running, securing the top spot 7 times. We were also recognized as the #2 Best Places to Work Inland Northwest and increased our ranking in various regional areas. Fostering a supportive work environment is a fundamental aspect of our organization and we strive to cultivate a culture of collaboration, innovation, and respect where team members are valued and empowered to contribute to our collective success. These accolades are a testament that we are succeeding in our efforts.
We were excited to roll out Central Plus Checking in 2024! This new account offers a wide range of benefits designed to provide comprehensive security, convenience, and added perks to enhance the lifestyle of our members. Over 25,000 members are using Central Plus which saves each member an average of $900 annually in cell phone protection, telehealth services, roadside assistance, identity theft resolution services, and several other benefits. Central Plus Checking is specifically tailored to meet the everyday needs of its members while providing added value and convenience.
Growth in key areas is a crucial factor that drives our success. We began 2024 by crossing $11 billion in assets and ended the year at $12.1 billion! This is a significant accomplishment in that we can help more members on their financial journey. Branch expansion remains a priority to ensure members have access to convenient locations. During 2024, we opened four new branches including Liberty Lake and Airway Heights in eastern Washington, North Ranch in the Treasure Valley, and Mountain Home. Additionally, we successfully merged with Health Care Idaho Credit Union inside St. Luke's Medical Center.
In 2024, we loaned $4.538 billion in consumer, commercial, and real estate loans, $437 million of which was loaned to businesses. Home and auto loans originated totaled $3.151 billion and $950 million represents loans generated through various other products including Visas, RVs, etc. During the year, membership increased 9.95%. At year end, we were serving the needs of 671,689 members and that number grows daily! As mentioned above, Idaho Central is now over $12.1 billion in assets and is ranked #18 in asset size in the country, compared to #21 in 2023.
Looking ahead, we remain committed to our mission and the value we add to our members, team members, and communities. We are grateful to our team members who are the backbone of ICCU, our members whose loyalty and trust inspire us to strive for excellence, and our Board of Directors and volunteers for their unwavering guidance and vision. Together we will continue to navigate the evolving financial landscape while meeting the needs of our members and driving sustainable growth.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT BY RSM US LLP - PAGE 1
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Idaho Central Credit Union and Subsidiary (the Credit Union), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial condition as of March 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, members' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, financial statements).
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Credit Union as of March 31, 2024, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Credit Union and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Other Matter
The financial statements of the Credit Union, as of and for the year ended March 31, 2023, were audited by other auditors, whose report, dated May 9, 2023, expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements.
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Credit Union's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT BY RSM US LLP - PAGE 2
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements, including omissions, are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.
In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we:
Â· Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
Â· Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Â· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Credit Union's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
Â· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Â· Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Credit Union's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.
We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal-control related matters that we identified during the audit.
