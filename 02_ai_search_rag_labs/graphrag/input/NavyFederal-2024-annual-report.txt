NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION
ANNUAL REPORT
OUR MEMBERS ARE
THE MISSI N. ®
To Our Members:
Ten years ago, in the spring of 2015, Navy Federal Credit Union had five million members and a global workforce of just over 12,000. It was then-as it is today-the world's largest credit union. Over the past decade, however, Navy Federal has undergone a period of remarkable growth, with membership now above 14 million and our staff totals exceeding 24,000.
Growth, we believe, is one of the outcomes of doing things the right way. If you have the right products, the right intentions and the right approach to member service, growth happens naturally. Over the past 92 years, so many people have invested so much to build this institution into what it is today. Because of their loyalty, their commitment and their belief in our mission, growth has become the standard at Navy Federal.
After a successful year across the credit union-including annual increases in our mortgage lending, credit card and consumer loan portfolios-Navy Federal's overall assets expanded by more than $10 billion last year, up to $180.8 billion. While growth will always come with its share of opportunities and challenges, one of the things that sets us apart from the market as a not-for-profit credit union is our pledge to invest these gains directly back into our members. With all the recent changes we've undergone, this foundational principal remains unchanged, and we continue looking for ways to expand our impact on members, their families and our communities.
From investing in security enhancements to our technology infrastructure and completing a massive data center migration undertaking, to launching a new mobile app that creates a simpler banking experience, our solid financial footing allows us to invest in the things that matter most to our members. We also expanded our network of branches-with more than 365 now operating globally-and established meaningful partnerships with the USO, the Bob Woodruff Foundation and other likeminded groups that help us broaden efforts to boost financial wellness nationwide. What's more, we extended our leadership within America's military community when we began operating the Department of Defense's Overseas Military Banking Program. Community Bank, as it is also known, serves a critical need for deployed U.S. servicemembers, providing over $1 billion in cash flow annually on bases across Europe and the Pacific.
Over the coming months, we'll continue our work to ensure every aspect of this credit union is designed to produce the very best experience possible for our members. We'll focus on better personalization, better service, better pricing and better technology. We're excited about the opportunities these changes create for our members, and we're confident they'll allow us to sustain a world-class level of service and support this year and beyond. As always, thank you for your partnership, for your support and for placing your trust in Navy Federal.
Sincerely,
Dietrich Kathrin

Expanding Services and Building Partnerships
Navy Federal initiated new partnerships designed to extend our support of all branches of the military, Veterans and their families.
Overseas Military Banking Program
The Department of Defense contracted with Navy Federal to assume operation of its Overseas Military Banking program, which provides banking services for more than 50,000 troops and their families stationed overseas. Known as Community Bank, Navy Federal began operating its 60 branches and 275 ATMs located in 10 countries. All the fees we earned from managing the Community Bank were donated to support partnerships with the USO, Bob Woodruff Foundation and other military service organizations.
Strategic Partnerships
Navy Federal launched partnerships with several organizations, including the USO and Bob Woodruff Foundation to help strengthen military communities. Our partnership with the USO focuses on enhancing financial education for America's men and women in uniform. Through a multi-year collective partnership with the Bob Woodruff Foundation, the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, the Air Force Aid Society, Coast Guard Mutual Assistance and Army Emergency Relief, Navy Federal's goal is to ensure that our nation's servicemembers and
Veterans have stable and successful futures. We also joined the African-American Credit Union Coalition to increase economic opportunities in underserviced communities.

Supervisory Committee
Input for the 2024 Annual Report
The Supervisory Committee provides the membership with an independent appraisal of the safety and soundness of Navy Federal's operations and activities. It does so in compliance with the Federal Credit Union Act and Navy Federal's bylaws. The Committee reviews all audit reports and meets quarterly to discuss audit results, Internal Audit recommendations for strengthening internal controls, and the status of management's action on all prior Internal Audit recommendations. The Supervisory Committee ensures that Navy Federal's financial statements provide a fair and accurate presentation of its financial condition and that management establishes and maintains sound internal controls to protect the assets of your credit union.
The Supervisory Committee employs the independent accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) to assist in meeting its responsibilities. The Committee meets regularly with PwC to evaluate audit results and to plan future audit work. PwC conducts quarterly procedures related to selected operations, and performs a comprehensive audit of the credit union's year-end financial statements. PwC's year-end audit, the Independent Auditor's Report, appears in this Annual Report.
Throughout the year, the committee reviews and responds in writing to letters and emails it receives from the membership. Both the membership and the management of Navy Federal benefit from this open communication because your individual concerns are addressed on a personal basis and your comments help to ensure that Navy Federal maintains the highest level of service to its members.
Acting as your ombudsman, the Supervisory Committee assures that all members are treated fairly by maintaining an open communication with the membership.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the regulatory agency for all federally chartered credit unions, also performs periodic supervisory examinations.
Based on the results of the Annual Report of Independent Auditors and the Examination Report of the NCUA, it is the opinion of your Supervisory Committee that Navy Federal continues to be financially strong and well managed, with sound policies and programs.

Report of Independent Auditors
To the Board of Directors and Supervisory Committee of Navy Federal Credit Union
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Navy Federal Credit Union and its subsidiaries (the "Company"), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in members' equity and of cash flows for the years then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements").
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Emphasis of Matter
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for the allowance for credit losses in 2023. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.
Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued.

Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements.
In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, we:
· Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
· Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.
We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization
Navy Federal Credit Union is a member-owned, not-for-profit financial institution formed in 1933 under the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act (FCUA) to provide a variety of financial services to those individuals in its field of membership, which includes Active Duty, Veterans and retired military and civilian personnel who are, or were, employed by the Department of Defense, Coast Guard and their families. Navy Federal is headquartered in Vienna, Virginia, with branch locations around the country and abroad.
Navy Federal Financial Group (NFFG), a wholly owned subsidiary of Navy Federal Credit Union, is a credit union service organization that provides investment, insurance and other financial services. Navy Federal Investment Services, LLC (NFIS) is a wholly owned subsidiary of NFFG. NFIS is an introducing broker-dealer facilitating access for its customers to investment and insurance products and investment advisory services. Navy Federal Credit Union and its consolidated entities are referred to as "Navy Federal" herein.
Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Navy Federal Credit Union and its wholly owned subsidiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on information available at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates.
Variable Interest Entities
An entity is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) if:
· its equity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties;
· its equity investors do not have decision-making rights about the entity's operations; or
· its equity investors do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity proportionally to their voting rights.
A variable interest is a contractual, ownership or other interest whose value changes as the fair value of the VIE's net assets change. Navy Federal's variable interests in VIEs arise from debt security investments in the form of Government-Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) issued securities, privately issued Mortgage-Backed Securities, an equity investment in a mutual fund, an equity investment in a private equity fund, as well as mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). These investments are presented within Note 2: Investments and Note 4: Loan Sales and Continuing Involvement in Assets Transferred. The fair value of the investments and MSRs represent Navy Federal's maximum exposure to VIEs. Navy Federal consolidates VIEs when considered the primary beneficiary. An entity is deemed the primary beneficiary of a VIE if that entity has both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (ii) the obligations to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Navy Federal is not required to consolidate any VIEs as of the reporting date since we are not considered the primary beneficiary.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, balances due from other financial institutions, cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) and short-term investments with maturities of three months or less. The maturity period is determined based on when we acquire the investment. Navy Federal has balances due from other financial institutions of $448.2 million and $154.5 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Investments
Navy Federal's investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale (AFS) or held-to-maturity (HTM) in accordance with ASC 320, Investments-Debt Securities. Debt securities are recorded on a trade
Navy Federal Credit Union . 2024 Annual Report
25
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
date basis. Debt securities classified as AFS are carried at fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Debt securities classified as HTM are carried at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Based on our investment strategy, management has the intent and ability to hold HTM securities until maturity. Gains and losses on dispositions are computed using the specific identification method and are included in Net gain/(loss) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For both AFS and HTM debt securities, interest income is recognized on an accrual basis, and premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted as an adjustment to interest income using the interest method. See Note 2: Investments for details.
Navy Federal evaluates its debt securities in an unrealized loss position for credit impairment in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, except for debt securities that are guaranteed by entities, including the U.S. Treasury and U.S. government-sponsored agencies where a zero-credit loss assumption is applied. Navy Federal assesses whether it (a) has the intent to sell the debt security, (b) is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security before recovering its amortized cost basis or (c) does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security even if it does not intend to sell the debt security. In order to determine whether the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security can be recovered, Navy Federal compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the AFS debt security to its amortized cost basis and considers (1) the amount, (2) adverse conditions specifically related to the AFS debt security or specific industry, (3) the volatility of the AFS debt security and its expected cash flows and (4) changes in ratings of the issuer. If Navy Federal does not intend to sell an impaired AFS debt security and it is not more likely than not that Navy Federal will be required to sell the AFS debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the impairment is separated into a credit component and a noncredit component. Expected cash flows are derived from our best estimate as of the reporting date. The credit component is recognized through the allowance for credit losses limited by the amount by which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis and the noncredit component is recognized in AOCI in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
If Navy Federal has the intent to sell, or it is more likely than not that Navy Federal will be required to sell, an impaired AFS debt security, impairment is recognized immediately within Net gain/(loss) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
When measuring expected credit losses related to AFS debt securities subject to prepayment risk, Navy Federal has elected to adjust the acquisition date effective interest rate to consider the timing of expected cash flows resulting from expected prepayments. As a result, the discount rate used to determine expected credit losses will match the rate used to recognize interest income as of the reporting date. If a variable rate asset requires credit loss measurement, Navy Federal has elected to utilize the rate in effect at the time a credit loss has been identified to calculate the effective interest rate for discounting purposes and to project cash flows.
If and when relevant, the unwinding of any discount due to the passage of time is considered a component of provision for credit losses. This election ensures that the reversal of any credit losses due to the passage of time is recorded as an offset to previously recognized credit losses in the same financial statement line item.
Navy Federal's investments in equity securities are classified as Equity securities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition in accordance with ASC 321, Investments-Equity Securities. Equity securities are recorded on a trade date basis. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value. Navy Federal recognizes dividend income from its equity investments in mutual funds on the date when the dividend is declared. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in earnings and included in Net gain/(loss) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 2: Investments for details.
Navy Federal has stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Atlanta. The carrying amounts are considered a reasonable estimate of fair value. FHLB stock is a restricted investment that is included in Investments in FHLB in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and is evaluated for impairment annually. There was no impairment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Navy Federal Credit Union . 2024 Annual Report
26
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
In accordance with ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are recorded at historical cost and accounted for as secured financings within Borrowed funds or short-term investments within Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, respectively.
Charitable Donation Account ("CDA")
A charitable donation account (CDA) is a hybrid charitable and investment vehicle that has been funded by Navy Federal as a means to provide charitable contributions and donations to qualified charities. The assets held with the CDA include investments in available-for-sale debt securities, as well as equity investments in a mutual fund and a private equity fund.
Loans
Navy Federal's loan portfolio consists of consumer, credit card and real estate loans. Consumer loans consist of secured consumer loans (auto loans) and unsecured consumer loans (signature loans, checking lines of credit and education loans). Real estate loans consist of mortgage and equity loans. Real estate loans also include loans where Navy Federal has purchased a participation interest in mortgage loans originated by other credit unions. At origination, all consumer, credit card and equity loans are classified as held for investment. Mortgage loans are classified as either mortgage loans held for investment or mortgage loans held for sale based on management's intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff.
In accordance with ASC 310, Receivables, loans held for investment are carried at the amount of unpaid principal balance (UPB) adjusted for net loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs, less an allowance for credit losses. Interest is accrued on consumer and real estate loans using the effective interest rate on a daily basis. Interest on credit card loans is accrued using the effective interest rate on a daily compounded basis. Accrued interest is presented separately from corresponding loans within Accounts receivable and accrued interest in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
In response to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") and Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised), Navy Federal has taken action to support members through offering a variety of assistance programs. Members requesting assistance were offered payment forbearance, payment extensions, payment deferrals and other types of loan modifications to help members deal with the effects of the pandemic (collectively referred to as "COVID-19 Loan Accommodations under the CARES Act"). As a result, certain loans receiving assistance due to COVID-19-related hardships were not being reported as past due based on the loan's original contractual term as of December 31, 2023. All other loans not receiving assistance due to COVID-19- related hardships were reported as delinquent when they were 30 days past due. As of December 31, 2024, all loans are reported as delinquent in accordance with the loan's original contractual term as loans are no longer receiving assistance due to COVID-19-related hardships.
When a loan becomes 90 days past due, accrued interest is reversed and the loan is placed into non-accrual status. For credit card loans, accrued interest is capitalized into the UPB in the month subsequent to the accrual and interest is no longer accrued on the loan past 90 days. Navy Federal does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable due to the reversal of uncollectible balances in a timely manner. Interest received on loans in non-accrual status is accounted for on a cash basis. Loans are returned to accrual status when the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and collection of remaining outstanding contractual payments is reasonably assured.
In accordance with ASC 310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs related to loans held for investment are deferred and amortized over the life of the loans as yield adjustments using the interest method for all products except for credit card loans, where fees and costs are netted, deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over 12 months.
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that Navy Federal will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual term. Navy Federal measures and recognizes impairment in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
Allowance for Credit Losses
On January 1, 2023, Navy Federal adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments and related ASUs (that collectively comprise ASC 326, also referred to herein as "CECL") that require the measurement of an allowance for credit losses ("ACL"), which represents management's best estimate of expected future credit losses related to loans, debt securities and off-balance sheet credit exposures that are not unconditionally cancelable. Upon adoption, using a modified retrospective approach, we recorded an increase to the allowance for credit losses of $1.9 billion based on the current economic conditions and portfolio balances as of January 1, 2023. The cumulative impact as a result of the adoption of CECL was a decrease to members' equity of $1.8 billion, which includes the impact from the reversal of liabilities related to unconditionally cancelable off- balance sheet credit exposures related to unfunded credit card lines, which had been measured under the incurred loss methodology. All credit card lines are considered unconditionally cancelable and therefore no longer require an allowance in accordance with CECL. See Note 3: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses for details.
The adoption of CECL did not have an impact on Navy Federal being categorized as "well-capitalized" under the NCUA's regulatory framework. See Note 13: Regulatory Matters.
The ACL represents management's best estimate of expected future credit losses related to loans, debt securities held at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures that are not unconditionally cancelable.
The ACL is a reserve against loans held for investment established through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the ACL when management believes the collectability of the loan amount is not probable. Recoveries on previously charged-off loans are credited to the ACL.
The ACL is based on historical loss experience, current borrower risk characteristics, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors. Navy Federal maintains the ACL at an appropriate level for expected losses on our existing loans held for investment, debt securities and unfunded commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable. The ACL is estimated considering the contractual term adjusted for prepayment expectations as of the balance sheet date. For products without a fixed contractual maturity date, Navy Federal relies on past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts to determine the length of the paydown time period or period in which a default may occur.
Navy Federal estimates expected losses using a combination of the expected losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period and the long run average expected losses for the remaining contractual term adjusted for prepayment expectations. Credit losses beyond the reasonable and supportable period are derived from long-run historical credit loss information adjusted for the credit quality of the current portfolio. Portfolio segments represent the level at which Navy Federal develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its ACL. Navy Federal's loan portfolio consists of three portfolio segments: consumer, credit card and real estate. Navy Federal utilizes probability of default models to determine the ACL.
For Chapter 7 bankruptcies, Navy Federal has elected the collateral-dependent practical expedient. For loans in which foreclosure is considered probable, expected credit losses are also based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. Loans that are not in foreclosure, except those undergoing a modification or are otherwise subject to a repayment plan, are generally charged- off to the ACL at 180 days past due.
The amortized cost of Navy Federal's loan portfolio excludes accrued interest receivable of $431.9 million and $384.8 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is presented as a component of Accounts receivable and accrued interest in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
Real Estate Loans
The ACL for loans secured by residential real estate is determined using quantitative methods supplemented with qualitative analysis. The ACL is calculated by estimating the number of loans that will default over the life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in estimated prepayments, using quantitative modeling
Navy Federal Credit Union . 2024 Annual Report
28
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
methodologies. The attributes that are significant in estimating the ACL include borrower FICO Score and delinquency status. The estimates are based on Navy Federal's historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook related to real estate prices is a key factor that impacts the frequency and severity of loss estimates.
Credit Cards
Credit cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined maturity date. The estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount and timing of expected future payments that it will take for a receivable balance to pay off, which is based on past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. The ACL calculation incorporates the spending behavior of a borrower through time using key borrower-specific factors and economic factors. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower FICO Score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model. Future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ACL as they are unconditionally cancelable.
Secured Consumer Loans
The ACL for secured consumer loans is determined using quantitative methods supplemented with qualitative analysis. The quantitative model estimates the ACL giving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit score and underlying collateral type.
Unsecured Consumer Loans
The ACL for unsecured consumer loans is determined using quantitative methods supplemented with qualitative analysis. The quantitative model estimates the ACL giving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status and borrower credit score.
Loan Restructurings
On January 1, 2023, using a modified retrospective approach, Navy Federal adopted the applicable provisions of ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures related to non-public business entities, which eliminated the accounting guidance for Troubled Debt Restructurings and added new disclosure requirements related to loan modifications provided to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The impact of the adoption of ASU 2022-02 was included within the $1.9 billion increase to the allowance for credit losses in connection with adopting CECL in the prior year.
Restructurings to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty result from our loss mitigation activities and include principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, payment delays, term extensions or combinations thereof. Restructured loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty continue to be subject to our existing nonaccrual policies. Expected losses or recoveries on loans where restructurings have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty have been factored into the ACL estimates for each loan portfolio segment. Significant judgment is required to determine if a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and these considerations vary by loan portfolio segment.
Navy Federal has elected the practical expedient to exclude accrued interest receivable balances from the required restructuring tables in Note 3: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses. Navy Federal has also elected to disclose all restructurings that result in payment delays within Note 3: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, including those restructurings that result in a delay in payment that is deemed insignificant.
Mortgage Loans Held for Sale
Navy Federal's mortgage loans held for sale portfolio consists of mortgage loans in which we have the intent and ability to sell. Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recorded as earned and is reported within Interest income-Loans in the Consolidated Statements of Income. ASC 825, Financial Instruments, permits entities to irrevocably elect to measure many financial instruments at fair value. Navy Federal has elected this fair value measurement option for mortgage loans classified as held for sale at origination; as such, these loans are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes to estimated fair value recognized in Net gain/(loss) on mortgage loans in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Fees earned and direct costs incurred associated with loans where the fair value option has been elected are recognized immediately within interest income.
Navy Federal reclassifies loans from held for investment to held for sale when we no longer have both the intent and ability to hold the loan for the foreseeable future, to maturity, or estimated time the loan will be
Navy Federal Credit Union . 2024 Annual Report
29
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
repaid. Mortgage loans reclassified to held for sale, for which we have not elected the fair value option at origination, are reported at lower of amortized cost or fair value. Any excess of a loan's amortized cost over its fair value is recognized as a valuation allowance in Net gain/(loss) on mortgage loans in the Consolidated Statements of Income, with subsequent changes in this valuation allowance also being recorded to Net gain/ (loss) on mortgage loans. Fair value is determined based on an evaluation of best forward sales contract prices sourced from the TBA market by agency. Previously recorded allowance for credit losses are reversed against the provision for credit losses upon transfer. Unamortized direct fees earned and direct costs are deferred until the related loan is sold. See Note 3: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses for details on mortgage loans transferred from held for investment to held for sale for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Loans are derecognized from the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition when sold, and sales treatment is applied when, in accordance with ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, the conditions for sale of financial assets are met. See Note 4: Loan Sales and Continuing Involvement in Assets Transferred for details.
In certain circumstances, mortgage loans designated as held for sale will no longer be sold. Upon this change of intent, Navy Federal transfers and reclassifies the loans as held for investment. Loans originated as held for sale for which the fair value option was elected will continue to be measured at fair value with subsequent changes in estimated fair value recognized in Net gain/(loss) on mortgage loans in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Mortgage Servicing Rights
Navy Federal recognizes mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) when mortgage loans are sold, and Navy Federal retains the right to service those loans. Navy Federal recognizes MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the Other line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Navy Federal recognizes revenue from servicing mortgage loans as earned based upon the specific contractual terms of the servicing arrangement. See Note 4: Loan Sales and Continuing Involvement in Assets Transferred for details.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Land held for use is carried at cost. Buildings, furniture, fixtures, equipment, computer software and capitalized information technology (IT) assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives. The cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from accounts when assets are disposed. Gains or losses upon disposition are included within the Other line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to earnings as incurred. Improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the extended useful life. Navy Federal purchases, as well as internally develops and customizes, certain software to enhance or perform internal business functions. Software development costs incurred in the planning and post-development project stages are charged to non-interest expense, and costs incurred in the application development stage are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over a five-year period. Leasehold improvements are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized over the lesser of the useful life or the remaining lease term. Useful lives for each asset category are estimated as follows:
Useful Life
Buildings
40 years
Leasehold improvements
5 years
Equipment, furniture and fixtures
5 to 7.5 years
Computer equipment
2 to 3 years
Computer software and capitalized IT assets
5 years
Lease Accounting
At contract inception, Navy Federal determines whether the contract is, or contains, a lease based on the term and conditions of the contract. In accordance with ASC 842, lease contracts for which Navy Federal is the lessee are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities. Lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present
Navy Federal Credit Union . 2024 Annual Report
30
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
value of the future lease payments over the expected lease term. ROU assets and related lease liabilities are included in Other assets and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Navy Federal utilizes the risk-free rate as a discount rate. The lease terms include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease depending on whether Navy Federal is reasonably certain to exercise such options. Navy Federal accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component and does not recognize the ROU assets and lease liabilities for any leases with terms of one year or less. Navy Federal recognizes the lease costs for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term whereas the variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Operating lease cost is included in Office operations and equipment in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Navy Federal's operating leases, where Navy Federal is a lessee, include office space, branches and ATMs. While Navy Federal has certain finance leases as a lessee, such leases are not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund Deposit
The deposit in the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) is in accordance with the FCUA and NCUA regulations, which require the maintenance of a deposit by each credit union in an amount equal to 1% of its insurable shares. The deposit would be refunded to Navy Federal if its insurance coverage is terminated or the operations of the fund are transferred from the NCUA Board.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Financial instruments that qualify as derivatives in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are financial contracts that derive their value from underlying changes in assets, rates or indices. Derivatives are used to hedge against changes in prices or interest rate movements that could adversely affect the value of certain assets or liabilities and future cash flows.
Navy Federal accounts for its derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815, which requires all derivative instruments to be carried at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Navy Federal executes and clears certain derivative transactions through derivative clearing organizations. Navy Federal's centrally cleared derivatives are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements, where we have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty. As such, Navy Federal reports these positions on a net basis in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. All derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value and classified as Other assets or Other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. See Note 5: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for details. Certain financial instruments, carried at amortized cost, that are purchased or originated by us, or borrowings may contain embedded derivatives such as certain interest rate features, default provisions or certain call features; however, these embedded derivatives do not require bifurcation as they are clearly and closely related to their host contracts.
Economic Hedges
Navy Federal enters into mortgage loan commitments, also called interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs), in connection with its mortgage banking activities to fund residential mortgage loans at specified times in the future. The IRLCs are considered derivative instruments under applicable accounting guidance and expose Navy Federal to the risk that the price of the loans underlying the commitments may decline between the inception of the rate lock and the funding date of the loan. Navy Federal is exposed to further price risk after the funding date until the mortgage loan is sold. To protect against price risk, Navy Federal enters into forward sales contracts with counterparties, transacting in exchange-traded U.S. Treasury futures contracts, as well as trading options on U.S. Treasury futures contracts. Changes in the fair value of all economic hedges executed to hedge against the volatility caused due to IRLCs and holding mortgage loans for sale are included in Net gain/(loss) on mortgage loans in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Accounting Hedges
In accordance with the provisions of ASC 815, derivative instruments can be designated as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. Navy Federal applies hedge accounting to qualifying hedging relationships. A qualifying hedging relationship exists when changes in the fair value of a derivative hedging instrument are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being
Navy Federal Credit Union . 2024 Annual Report
31
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
hedged during the term of the hedging relationship. Fair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the value of assets and liabilities as a result of interest rate volatility. Navy Federal uses interest rate swaps as fair value hedges to offset the change in value of its certain fixed-rate AFS debt securities. Changes in the fair value of fair value hedges are recorded in the same Consolidated Statements of Income line item as the related hedged item. Cash flow hedges are used to minimize the variability in cash flows resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Navy Federal uses interest rate swaps to hedge against the variability in cash flows of its floating-rate debt payments. Changes in fair value of cash flow hedges are reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same Consolidated Statements of Income line as the hedged item.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, Navy Federal formally documents the hedged item, the particular risk management objective, the nature of the risk being hedged, the derivative being used, how effectiveness of the hedge will be assessed and how ineffectiveness of the hedge will be measured. Navy Federal utilizes a regression analysis at the inception of a hedge and a qualitative analysis for each reporting period thereafter to assess whether the derivative is expected to be, and has been, highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item.
Navy Federal discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined the derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge; the derivative expires or is sold or terminated; the derivative is de- designated; or in the case of a cash flow hedge, it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time frame. Subsequent to discontinuing a fair value or cash flow hedge, the derivative will continue to be recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value, with changes in fair value included in earnings. For a discontinued fair value hedge, the previously hedged item is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value. If the forecasted transaction is no longer probable to occur, Navy Federal discontinues hedge accounting designation and immediately recognizes the previously unrealized gain or loss in AOCI into earnings. For other discontinuing type events, the unrealized gain or loss continues to be deferred in AOCI until the forecasted transaction affects earnings. See Note 5: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for details.
Margin and Collateral
In connection with certain derivative financial instruments, Navy Federal is required to post initial and/ or variation margin in accordance with our futures clearing merchant and derivative clearing organization policies. Navy Federal's centrally cleared derivative contracts are considered either "collateralized" or "settled" on a daily basis as a result of margin requirements. Variation margin posted in connection with settled contracts is considered to be within the same unit of account as the derivative financial instrument for the purposes of presentation of the net fair value within the financial statements. When subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement, it is Navy Federal's policy to offset all collateral receivable or payable with related derivative liabilities or assets, respectively, and to net such amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Any securities pledged as margin do not impact presentation of net fair value of derivative assets/liabilities as Navy Federal does not surrender effective control over the securities when posting as collateral. The securities pledged are not derecognized from the balance sheet as a result of the pledge.
Pension Accounting and Retirement Benefit Plans
Navy Federal has a defined benefit pension plan, 401(k) defined contribution and 457(b) savings plans, and a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan. Navy Federal also provides a postretirement medical plan for certain retired employees. Navy Federal accounts for its defined benefit pension plan and postretirement medical plan in accordance with ASC 715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits. See Note 10: Retirement Benefit Plans for details.
Fair Value Measurement
Navy Federal measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date. Navy Federal employs various valuation approaches to measure fair value, including market and income approaches. The market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions
Navy Federal Credit Union . 2024 Annual Report
32
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. Valuation techniques and parameters used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by Navy Federal on an annual basis. In measuring fair value, Navy Federal maximizes the use of quoted prices and observable inputs.
The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that ranks the inputs used in fair value measurement based on their reliability. The fair value hierarchies are defined as follows:
· Level 1-Valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical instruments.
· Level 2-Valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions (rates, volatilities, credit spreads) for financial instruments are observable.
· Level 3-Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions that are not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques.
Generally, uncertainties in fair value measurements of financial instruments using unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in the opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, changes in interest rates, constant prepayment rates, servicing costs, best execution forward contract prices or other relevant inputs may result in a significant increase or decrease in the Level 3 fair value measurement of a particular asset or liability as of the reporting date. See Note 14: Fair Value Measurement for additional information.
Revenue Recognition
Non-interest income includes revenue from various types of transactions and services provided to members and customers, which primarily consists of Interchange income and Fee and other income. Revenue from contracts with customers is earned by Navy Federal in exchange for services provided to customers and recognized when services are completed or as they are rendered and based on agreed-upon rates. The majority of the contracts with customers are short-term in nature and can be terminated by our members or customers at any time.
Interchange income consists of credit and debit card fees for standing ready to authorize and provide settlement on card transactions processed through the payment networks. Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement with the payment networks. Interchange rates are set by the payment network and are variable in nature as they are based on transaction volumes and other factors.
Interchange income is reported net of the cost of rewards programs based on card usage. The rewards cost totaled $729.8 million and $673.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The majority of Fee and other income relates to service charges on deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services such as ATM usage, returned items fees and other deposit-related fees. The revenue from these fees is recognized when services or transactions are completed and are based on the type of services provided and agreed-upon rates. Payments for services provided are either withdrawn from the member's account as services are rendered or in the billing period following the completion of the service.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in Marketing in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Income Taxes
Pursuant to the FCUA, Navy Federal is exempt from federal and state income taxes.

Dividends
Dividend rates on deposit accounts are set by Navy Federal's Board of Directors. Dividends are charged to Dividends on deposits in the Consolidated Statements of Income and paid to members monthly.
Overseas Military Banking Program
Effective April 1, 2024, Navy Federal began operating the Overseas Military Banking Program ("OMBP" or "the program") pursuant to a contract within the Department of Defense ("DoD"). Navy Federal provides banking operations services for the program as directed by the DoD. The program began post-World War II with a mission of providing U.S. servicemembers, and their dependents stationed overseas, access to customary banking services. Operations are provided under the name "Community Bank operated by Navy Federal Credit Union" and are fully funded by the U.S. Government through the DoD. Program assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses are not recorded within the Company's financial statements as the Company does not have legal rights to them. The DoD governs and prescribes all aspects of the program's business activities that may be allowable under the contract. NFCU's contract with the DoD is a service contract, whereby NFCU will earn revenue from a contract with the U.S. Government (DoD) as the "customer", and therefore such revenue is accounted for based on guidance under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The contract is a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract with a base period of one year and eight one-year option periods.
Navy Federal provides the program access to the FRB and receives funding from the program for the purpose of settling daily cash transactions. Navy Federal recognizes a corresponding payable due to or receivable due from the program, as appropriate depending on the program's cash transactions at the FED.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Navy Federal early adopted ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, as of January 1, 2024 on a prospective basis. The ASU clarifies the determination of fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. Under ASU 2022-03, contractual sale restrictions are not considered in measuring fair value. As a result, contractual sale restrictions did not impact fair value of our equity securities as of December 31, 2024.
Note 2: Investments
HTM and AFS Debt Securities
Navy Federal's HTM debt securities are issued or guaranteed by either the U.S. government or a federal agency. The amortized cost of Navy Federal's HTM debt securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $1.3 billion and $650.1 million, respectively. Taking into consideration the risk profile of the issuers of our HTM securities, historical information, and current and forecasted conditions, we do not expect credit losses on these securities as of the period ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Management performs periodic assessments to reevaluate this conclusion by considering any changes in credit quality of the issuer, historical losses, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Navy Federal's AFS debt securities portfolio consists of U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities; GSEs or Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) backed residential mortgage-backed securities; private commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), bank notes and corporate bonds; municipality bonds; and other securities.

Navy Federal held 692 AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2024. All securities in an unrealized loss position were reviewed individually for impairment as discussed in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Navy Federal does not intend to sell nor would Navy Federal be, more likely than not, required to sell these securities before recovering their amortized cost basis. The unrealized losses associated with these investments are not a result of changes in the credit quality of the issuers; rather, the losses are reflective of changing market interest rates.
As of December 31, 2024, based on a review of each of the securities in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, we concluded that we expected to realize the amortized cost basis of each security. No AFS debt securities realized a credit loss for the periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, nor were we required to recognize an allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The tables below present the gross unrealized losses and fair value of securities available-for-sale that do not have an associated allowance as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. These securities are segregated between investments that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and twelve months or more, based on the point in time that the fair value declined below the amortized cost basis. All

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
securities included in the table have been evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. All securities with unrealized losses were evaluated, and the unrealized losses associated with these investments are not a result of changes in the credit quality of the issuers; rather, the losses are reflective of changing market interest rates. All securities with unrealized losses are contractually current on payments and have credit ratings of "BBB-" equivalent or higher. Additionally, for the CMBS holdings, the current subordination levels are equal to or higher than the subordination levels at purchase. As part of our credit impairment assessment, as of December 31, 2024, we concluded that we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis.

With the adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2023, expected credit losses on investment securities are required to be recognized through an allowance, instead of as a direct write-down to the amortized cost basis of the security. The amortized cost basis of investment securities for which impairment had previously been recorded did not change upon adoption.
We maintain the allowance for investment securities at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our portfolio. No allowance for expected credit losses was required as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a discussion of the methodologies used to determine the allowance for investment securities.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Navy Federal had pledged $201.0 million and $185.1 million, respectively, of investment securities as collateral with counterparties for derivative transactions under master netting agreements. See Note 5: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for derivative transactions under master netting agreements. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Navy Federal pledged $1.0 billion in investment securities to the FHLB as collateral to borrow funds. See Note 9: Borrowed Funds for maturity information of the associated liabilities.
Equity Securities
Navy Federal's equity securities consist of investments in mutual funds, a private equity investment and redeemable common stock. Navy Federal recognized realized gains on the sale of equity securities of $230.2

million and zero as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Navy Federal recognized unrealized gains on equity securities of $56.9 million and $97.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 relating to equity securities held as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Visa® Share Conversion
On January 24, 2024, Navy Federal's Visa Class B common shares were redenominated to Visa Class B-1 common shares. On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange offer for all outstanding Visa B-1 common shares. Navy Federal exchanged all outstanding Visa Class B-1 common shares for a combination of Visa Class B-2 common shares and Visa Class C common shares. The Visa Class B-1 common share to B-2 common share exchange was at cost basis, resulting in no gain/loss for the year ended December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, total realized gain on sale of equity securities includes $169.6 million from the conversion and then sale of all Visa Class C common shares.

As a result of COVID-19 Loan Accommodations, certain loans modified due to COVID-19-related hardships are not being reported as past due based on the contractual terms of the loan as of December 31, 2023. See Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional details.
Non-Accrual Loans
When a loan becomes 90 days past due, accrued interest is reversed and the loan is placed into non-accrual status. For credit card loans, accrued interest is capitalized into the UPB in the month subsequent to the accrual and interest is no longer accrued on the loan past 90 days. Refer to the delinquency status tables above for consumer, credit card and real estate loans on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2024.
During 2023, real estate loans that received COVID-19 Loan Accommodations under the CARES Act were placed on non-accrual under the same policy. As a result, loans are not reported as delinquent due to receiving COVID-19 Loan Accommodations but are classified as non-accrual due to missing three consecutive payments. As of December 31, 2023, real estate loans on non-accrual status were $453.0 million. Refer to the delinquency table above for consumer and credit card loans on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2023.

Credit Quality
Navy Federal closely monitors the credit quality of its loan portfolio based on economic conditions, loan performance trends and certain risk attributes. The risks in Navy Federal's loan portfolios correlate to broad economic trends, which are monitored in conjunction with borrowers' risk attributes. The risks that may affect the default experience on Navy Federal's loan portfolios include changes in economic conditions, which are monitored in conjunction with various loan attributes such as delinquency status, borrower credit score and historical payment behavior. This information is utilized to evaluate the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses. Navy Federal evaluates the appropriateness of credit quality indicators annually. Along with on-going monitoring of delinquency trends and losses, we use a national third-party provider to update FICO credit scores monthly for use in our ongoing credit analysis.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Navy Federal uses current delinquency status and FICO Score as an indicator of credit quality for all loan portfolios. For delinquency status as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, refer to the loan composition and delinquency status table above.
The following table summarizes our loans by FICO Scores as of December 31:

Collateral-Dependent Loans
A loan is considered to be collateral-dependent when repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral underlying the loan and when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In the case of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the loan is also considered collateral-dependent as the bankruptcy court "removed" the borrower (the primary source of repayment) from responsibility to continue to make payments called for by the original loan agreement. As such, the loan is collateral-dependent because repayment depends solely on the sale of collateral. Loans within our foreclosure pipeline are also considered collateral-dependent. For collateral-dependent loans, the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the collateral (less costs to sell, if applicable) is used to determine the allowance for credit losses. For additional information regarding collateral-dependent assets, see Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
The amortized cost of real estate loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in process of foreclosure was $198.7 million and $160.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The amortized cost of real estate loans subject to Chapter 7 bankruptcy was $146.2 million and $123.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Loan Restructurings
We offer several types of loan restructurings to borrowers that may result in a payment delay, interest rate reduction, term extension, principal forgiveness or combination thereof. Payment delays include partial satisfaction of debt and significant delay, including payment deferrals, forbearance, term extensions or a combination thereof. Navy Federal does not distinguish other-than-insignificant from significant payment delays per ASC 310-10-50-46 and elects to disclose all payment delays. Navy Federal considers a borrower to be experiencing financial difficulty when the type of modification granted is directly indicative of financial hardship (e.g., bankruptcy, principal forgiveness, repossessed autos, consolidation of delinquent debts, real estate modifications). For all other modification types, a determination of borrower financial difficulty is made if a loan was 30 or more days past due at least once in the 12 months prior to modification.
The table below presents the amortized cost of loan restructurings involving borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were entered into during the periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

While a loan is in a forbearance plan or repayment plan, payments continue to be due based on the loan's original contractual terms because the loan has not been permanently restructured. As a result, loans in forbearance plans and repayment plans are reported as delinquent to the extent that payments are past due based on the loan's original contractual terms. Loans that have been restructured by entering into a payment deferral plan or loan restructuring are reported as delinquent to the extent that payments are past due based on the loan's restructured terms.

Loan Transfers
Navy Federal reclassified $82.0 million and $28.0 million of mortgage loans held for sale to mortgage loans held for investment during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, Navy Federal did not reclassify any mortgage loans from held for investment to mortgage loans held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Navy Federal reclassified $2.8 billion of mortgage loans held for investment to mortgage loans held for sale due to change in management's intent to hold these loans until maturity. At the date of transfer, Navy Federal reversed $4.3 million of allowance for credit losses on the $2.8 billion of mortgage loans transferred.
Note 4: Loan Sales and Continuing Involvement in Assets Transferred
In the normal course of business, Navy Federal originates and transfers qualifying residential mortgage loans in securitization or sales transactions in which it has continuing involvement. Loans are sold to Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, collectively the Government- Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) and Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). The GSEs and GNMA generally securitize loans into mortgage-backed securities that are sold to third-party investors in the secondary market or retained by Navy Federal for investment purposes. Navy Federal may also sell loans that were previously retained for investment purposes to private third-party investors.
Navy Federal sold/securitized $8.2 billion and $3.3 billion of first mortgage loans during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following table provides a summary of the cash flows exchanged between Navy Federal and transferees on all loans transferred during the years ended December 31:

Navy Federal earns servicing and other ancillary fees for its role as servicer. Navy Federal's servicing fees are priced based on parameters set by the GSEs and GNMA. Navy Federal's servicing revenue is included in Mortgage servicing revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Navy Federal received $2.0 million and $1.9 million of late charges and miscellaneous fees, which is included in Fee and other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Navy Federal's responsibilities as servicer typically include collecting and remitting monthly principal and interest payments, maintaining escrow deposits, performing loss mitigation and foreclosure activities, and in certain instances, funding servicing advances that have not yet been collected from the borrower. Navy Federal recognizes servicing advances in Accounts receivable and accrued interest in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Servicing advances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 totaled $99.8 million and $104.2 million, respectively.

Retained Investment in GNMA Securities
GNMA securities backed by Navy Federal loans may be retained as investments by Navy Federal and classified as AFS debt securities. See Note 2: Investments for details.
In accordance with ASC 860-20, Sales of Financial Assets, the effect of two negative changes in each of the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of Navy Federal's investment in GNMA securities must be disclosed. The negative effect of each key assumption change must be calculated independently, holding all other assumptions constant. The table below details the key assumptions used in Navy Federal's analysis, specifically, CPR and weighted-average life.

The sensitivities in the table above are hypothetical and may not be indicative of actual results. The effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value is calculated independently of changes in other assumptions. Further, changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption on the fair value may not be linear.
The fair value of GNMA securities held by Navy Federal was $243.3 million and $284.8 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
GNMA Early Pool Buyback Program
Navy Federal has the option to repurchase pooled loans out of GNMA securities when members fail to make payments for three consecutive months. As Navy Federal has the unilateral ability to repurchase these loans, effective control over the loans has been regained. Navy Federal recognizes an asset in mortgage loans held for sale and a corresponding liability in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition regardless of whether it has the intent to repurchase the loan. Of the loans that became eligible for repurchase under the Early Pool Buyback Program, $86.3 million and $69.8 million were repurchased out of GNMA securities during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The loans bought out of GNMA securities are recorded as mortgage loans held for investment. On December 31, 2024 and 2023, amounts associated with the Early Pool Buyback Program recognized in Mortgage loans held for sale and Other liabilities totaled $122.8 million and $107.4 million, respectively.
Financial Guarantees Related to Recourse Provided in Assets Transferred Representations and Warranties
For mortgage loans transferred in sale transactions or securitizations to the GSEs, GNMA and other investors, Navy Federal has made representations and warranties that the loans meet specified requirements. These requirements typically relate to collateral, underwriting standards, validation of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan and the use of standard legal documentation. In connection with the sale of loans to the GSEs, GNMA and other investors, Navy Federal may be required to repurchase the loan or indemnify the respective entity for losses due to breaches of these representations and warranties.
Navy Federal recognizes a liability for estimated losses related to representations and warranties from the inception of the obligation when the loans are sold. This liability is included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. In the Consolidated Statements of Income, the related expense is included as an offset to Net gain/(loss) on mortgage loans for loans sold during the current period, or in Servicing expense
Navy Federal Credit Union . 2024 Annual Report
43
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
for re-measurement of the liability related to loans sold in prior periods. Navy Federal's estimated representations and warranties liability on December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $6.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively.
Management believes the liability for representations and warranties appropriately reflects the estimated probable losses on indemnification and repurchase claims for all loans sold and outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. In making these estimates, Navy Federal considers the losses expected to be incurred over the weighted average life of the sold loans. While management seeks to obtain all relevant information in estimating this liability, the estimation process is inherently uncertain and imprecise, and accordingly, it is reasonably possible future losses could be more or less than Navy Federal's established liability. On December 31, 2024 and 2023, Navy Federal estimates it is reasonably possible it could incur additional losses more than its accrued liability of up to approximately $22.1 million and $27.1 million, respectively.
The total UPB subject to representations and warranties was $37.7 billion and $33.6 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Note 5: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Navy Federal's risk management strategies include the use of derivatives as economic hedges and derivatives designated as qualifying accounting hedges. The goal of these strategies is to mitigate market risk so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect the value of Navy Federal's assets or liabilities, earnings or future cash flows. The fair value of derivative instruments is presented in a gain or loss position, net, for those that are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements, and is reported in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

Offsetting Derivative Financial Instruments
As discussed in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, some of Navy Federal's derivative instruments are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements, where we have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty. As such, Navy Federal reports these positions in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition on a net basis.
The following tables present total gross derivative assets and liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023, which are adjusted to reflect the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. The following tables also include financial instruments or cash collateral related to legally enforceable master netting agreements that represent securities or cash collateral received or pledged with the same counterparty. These amounts are not offset in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, but are shown as a reduction to total derivative assets and liabilities to derive net derivative assets and liabilities.

Derivatives Accounted For as Economic Hedges
Navy Federal is an active participant in the production of mortgage loans that are sold to investors in the secondary market. At origination, these loans are classified as Mortgage loans held for sale in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Prior to origination, the corresponding IRLCs related to Mortgage loans held for sale expose Navy Federal to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates between the time of the loan commitment and the time Navy Federal funds the loan. Navy Federal is also exposed to the risk of adverse changes in value after funding the loan up until the time when the loan is delivered to the investor. To offset this exposure, Navy Federal enters into forward sales contracts to deliver mortgage loans to investors at specified prices in the "To Be Announced" market (TBA securities). These forward sales contracts act as an economic

45
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
hedge against the risk of changes in the value of both the IRLCs and the funded loans. In 2023, Navy Federal began transacting in U.S. Treasury futures contracts and options on U.S. Treasury futures to economically hedge the value of a portion of the IRLCs and Held for Sale loans as a result of changing market interest rates. Navy Federal accounts for these financial instruments as derivatives in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.

Derivatives Accounted For as Qualifying Accounting Hedges
Under the provisions of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, derivative instruments may be designated as a qualifying cash flow hedge.
Cash Flow Accounting Hedges
Navy Federal funds a portion of its operations with variable rate debt obligations. Navy Federal uses pay-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows related to existing and anticipated replacement FHLB borrowings that reprices based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same Consolidated Statements of Income line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.
The table below summarizes gains and losses on cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31:

During the next 12 months, net gains in AOCI of approximately $17.7 million on derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges are expected to be reclassified into earnings.
For open or future cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are or will be hedged is approximately 10 years.
Note 6: Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
In the normal course of business, Navy Federal enters into commitments to extend credit and makes financial guarantees to help meet the financing needs of its members. Unfunded loan commitments are amounts Navy Federal has agreed to lend to a member generally as long as the member remains in good standing on existing loans. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Navy Federal uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for all loans, and accordingly, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, the potential credit risk related to these commitments could be similar to existing loans, if these commitments became funded loans.

Note 10: Retirement Benefit Plans
Navy Federal Credit Union Employees' Retirement Plan
Navy Federal Credit Union Employees' Retirement Plan (the Plan) is a defined benefit retirement plan with benefits based on set formulas. Navy Federal transitioned to a Cash Balance design as of January 1, 2001, but retained the Traditional design for those employees who opted to remain under the Traditional formula. The following describes how the benefits are calculated:
· Cash Balance-This design provides either a single sum payment upon retirement or a monthly annuity. The annuity option is available for each Cash Balance Plan participant who has a benefit value of more than $5,000.
· Traditional-This design provides a lifetime of monthly retirement benefits, determined by a set formula. The formula is based on the final average earnings (an average of the three highest consecutive years of income) multiplied by 2%, times the length of employee service.
Retiree Medical Plan
Navy Federal provides to employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, postretirement benefits to offset the cost of medical insurance premiums or out-of-pocket medical expenses. The plan provides a lump sum, notionally credited, to a health reimbursement account equal to $75 or $100 (depending on the retiree's age on September 1, 2008), multiplied by the number of years of continuous service the retiree provided to Navy Federal, multiplied by a lump sum factor.
The pension assets, net of the accumulated benefit obligation, are recognized in Other assets and the retiree medical plan liabilities are recognized in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The following table provides key balances and transaction amounts of the pension and retiree medical plans as of and for the years ended December 31:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
As of December 31, 2024, the increase in projected benefit obligation for the pension plan was mainly driven by plan experience, including new entrants, resulting in an increase of service costs and interest costs and an increase in the cash balance crediting rate assumption, partially offset by an increase in the discount rate. As of December 31, 2024, the change in the projected benefit obligation for the retiree medical plan was mainly driven by an increase in the discount rate.
As of December 31, 2023, the increase in projected benefit obligation for the pension plan was mainly driven by a decrease in the discount rate and plan experience, including new entrants, an increase in the change of the salary scale assumption and an increase in the cash balance interest crediting rate assumption. As of December 31, 2023, the change in the projected benefit obligation for the retiree medical plan was mainly driven by a decrease in the discount rate.
Navy Federal reports service cost and other components of net periodic benefit cost in Salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The anticipated employer contribution for 2025 is $25.0 million for the pension plan and $3.8 million for the retiree medical benefit plan. The measurement date for the pension and retiree medical benefit plan for 2024 and 2023 was December 31.
The investment strategy of the Plan is to employ an approach whereby a mix of equity and fixed-income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets at a prudent level of risk that includes consideration of benefit obligation volatility. The intent of this strategy is to keep the Plan well-funded over the long run. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities and plan-funded status. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and regular investment portfolio reviews.
As of December 31, 2024, the target allocation of plan assets was 25% U.S. equity securities, 40% global equity securities and 35% fixed-income securities. Most of the U.S. equity assets are invested in a large company index fund and in a defensive equity fund with the balance in small- and mid-sized company equity securities. Most of the global equity allocation is in developed markets around the world, with the balance in emerging markets. The fixed-income allocation comprises a small allocation to cash to provide liquidity for benefit and expense payments, with the balance invested in intermediate and long-term bonds, the majority of which are investment-grade.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to value fixed income securities that are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Municipal bonds, corporate bonds and corporate notes are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. Asset-backed securities and non-agency collateralized mortgage obligation securities are valued using observable inputs based on similar assets in the marketplace.
Navy Federal Credit Union . 2024 Annual Report
51
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
Certain investments are measured at net asset value (NAV) per share, or its equivalent, as a practical expedient and therefore are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments are valued at NAV, which is calculated based on the underlying investments and is provided by the respective investment managers as a practical expedient to estimate fair values. Most of the underlying investments are traded in markets that are considered to be active. For those underlying investments that are not considered to be actively traded, the fair values are based on quoted market prices of similar assets, dealer quotations or valuations from pricing sources supported by observable inputs.
The preceding methods may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realized value or reflective of future fair values. Although Navy Federal believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
Interest in the investments measured at NAV can be purchased or redeemed at specified times during the month with advance notice of one to five days. For one investment, settlement of redemptions of more than $1.0 million will occur 10 business days following the trade date. For a second investment, significant contributions or redemptions require notice of 15 business days in advance of the trade date. There were no other significant redemption terms or conditions for the other investments measured at NAV.
Navy Federal 401(k) Savings Plan
The Navy Federal 401(k) savings plan is a defined contribution plan where employees can contribute up to the statutory limits to a 401(k) retirement account and receive employer matching contributions. The matching contribution percentage is based on the formula the employee receives in the defined benefit retirement plan. Employees eligible for the Cash Balance benefit receive a 100% employer match on the first 7% of pay they contribute to their 401(k) account up to IRS limits and are vested after completing two years of service. The employees eligible for the Traditional benefit receive an employer match of 50% on the first 7% of pay they contribute to their 401(k) account up to IRS limits.
The expense recognized for the 401(k) Plan, including matching contributions and administrative costs, was $129.2 million and $115.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Deferred Compensation Plan
The Navy Federal 457(b) deferred compensation plan is a non-qualified plan that offers a before-tax savings opportunity to highly compensated employees. The annual deferral amount allowed mirrors the 401(k) Plan limits, and contributions held by Navy Federal earn monthly interest based on Navy Federal's monthly gross income divided by average earning assets (loans and investments).
Non-Qualified Supplemental Retirement Plans
The non-qualified supplemental retirement plans are primarily designed to "make up" for benefits not paid through the qualified retirement plans as a result of IRS limitations. Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) limits the amount of compensation that can be used in a qualified retirement plan calculation, and Internal Revenue Code Section 415 limits the amount of monthly annuity that can be paid from a defined benefit plan.
All benefits are paid from Navy Federal's assets and are in compliance with all federal laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total liability related to these plans was $2.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively.
Note 11: Related Party Transactions
In the normal course of business, Navy Federal extends loans to and receives deposits from credit union officials. Credit union officials are defined as volunteer members of the Board of Directors and board committees, and employees with the title of Vice President and above. The total outstanding loan balance extended to credit union officials as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $80.4 million and $75.3 million, respectively. The total deposit balance of credit union officials as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $43.6 million and $43.7 million, respectively. Loans to credit union officials are made under similar terms as loans entered into by all members. Deposit accounts held by credit union officials earn interest at the same rates provided to all other members.

Note 13: Regulatory Matters
Navy Federal is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the NCUA. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Navy Federal's consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy regulations and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, Navy Federal must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of Navy Federal's assets, liabilities and certain commitments as calculated under U.S. GAAP. Navy Federal's capital amounts and net worth classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by its regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
A credit union is defined as "complex" and a risk-based capital measure is applicable only if the credit union's most recent quarter-end total assets exceed $500 million. A complex credit union may calculate its risk-based capital measure either by using the risk-based capital ratio, or, if a qualifying complex credit union, by opting into the Complex Credit Union Leverage Ratio (CCULR) framework.
For a complex credit union to be categorized as "well capitalized", it must maintain a minimum net worth ratio of 7% and maintain a minimum risk-based capital ratio of 10%. For a qualifying "complex" credit union opting into the CCULR framework to be categorized as "well capitalized", it must maintain a minimum CCULR of 9%. If the CCULR falls below 9% but is greater than or equal to 7%, the credit union has two calendar quarters of grace period either to satisfy the requirements to be "well capitalized" under the CCULR framework or to calculate its risk-based capital ratio. If a complex credit union has a net worth ratio below 7% but greater than or equal to 6% and a risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, it is categorized as "adequately capitalized". If a complex credit union has a net worth ratio below 6% or a risk-based capital ratio of below 8%, it is categorized as "undercapitalized".
Navy Federal Credit Union . 2024 Annual Report
53
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
Navy Federal opts into the CCULR framework and is categorized as "well capitalized" under the NCUA regulatory framework for prompt corrective action as a result of having a CCULR of 11.62% and 11.63% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The components of Navy Federal's capital are stable, and the occurrence of factors that could significantly affect capital adequacy is considered to be remote as they are limited to extraordinary regulatory or economic events. There are no conditions or events that have occurred since December 31, 2024 that management believes would have changed Navy Federal's categorization.
Note 14: Fair Value Measurement
Navy Federal measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, through various valuation approaches as described in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Management has not made significant changes in the valuation techniques and parameters used for the fair value measurement of its financial assets and liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Financial Assets and Liabilities Accounted For at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following are the valuation methodologies and inputs used by Navy Federal in estimating the fair value of assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Available-for-Sale Debt Securities
Navy Federal receives pricing for AFS debt securities from a third-party pricing service provider. Below includes the valuation methodologies used for AFS debt securities classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
. U.S. Government and Federal Agency Securities, Bank Notes and Corporate Bonds, Municipal Securities and Other Securities-These financial instruments are valued based on similar assets in the marketplace or derived from model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable.
· Residential and Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities-These financial instruments include GSE- issued securities, GNMA-guaranteed securities and non-agency securities. The fair value is determined using a market approach. The inputs used in the fair value measurements are based upon readily observable transactions for securities with similar characteristics (such as issuer/guarantor, coupon rate, stated maturity and collateral pool characteristics) occurring on the measurement date.
Equity Securities
Navy Federal's equity securities primarily consist of investments in mutual funds and a private equity fund. Mutual funds are valued based on quoted market price in an active market and classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of Navy Federal's investment in the private equity fund has been determined using the net asset value (NAV) of NFCU's ownership interest as a practical expedient. The private equity fund reports its investment assets at fair value and has all the attributes of an investment company, pursuant to ASC Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies (ASC 946). NAV provided by the private equity fund is as of NFCU's measurement date and is calculated in a manner consistent with the fair value measurement principles established by ASC 820. Since NAV is used as a practical expedient, the fair value of the Private Equity Fund does not fall within the fair value hierarchy.
Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value
Navy Federal elects the fair value option for certain mortgage loans held for sale at origination. The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is determined based on an evaluation of best execution forward sales contract prices sourced from the TBA market by agency. As such, mortgage loans held for sale are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Loans Held for Investment, at Fair Value
Loans held for investment that are transferred from mortgage loans held for sale, for which the fair value option was elected at the time of origination, continue to be valued at fair value. These loans do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. A discounted cash flow method is applied to determine the fair value, which projects future cash flows of an asset, and discounts them back to a present value. As significant unobservable inputs are utilized in the valuation, these loans are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Navy Federal Credit Union . 2024 Annual Report
54
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
Mortgage Servicing Rights
MSR assets do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. The fair value of MSR is determined by discounting projected net servicing cash flows. Actual and expected loan prepayment rate, discount rate, servicing costs and other economic factors are all considered in measuring the MSR fair value. The valuation model and underlying assumptions are corroborated by values received from independent third parties and through comparisons to market transactions. The fair value of Navy Federal's MSR portfolio is primarily affected by changes in mortgage interest rates resulting in loan prepayment acceleration factors to increase or decrease. As the MSR valuation is based on unobservable inputs, MSR assets are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Derivative Assets and Liabilities
Fair values of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are determined based on third-party models that calculate the net present value of future cash flows discounted using the USD SOFR. Counterparty non- performance risk is considered by discounting future cash flows using the USD SOFR adjusted for credit quality. As the inputs utilized in the valuation are observable in the market, interest rate swaps are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Fair values of forward sales contracts on TBA securities are determined based on an evaluation of best execution forward contract prices sourced from the TBA market, by agency. As such, forward sales contracts are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Navy Federal utilizes Chicago Mercantile Exchange as the principal market (exchange) to transact in U.S. Treasury futures contracts and options on U.S. Treasury futures. The fair value of both of these instruments therefore is readily determinable and observable via the unadjusted bids and asks of exchange participants. As such, these instruments are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
Fair values of IRLCs are determined based on an evaluation of best execution forward contract prices sourced from the TBA market, adjusted by a factor that represents the probability it will settle and become a mortgage loan held for sale. As there are significant unobservable inputs in the fair value measurement, IRLCs are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
