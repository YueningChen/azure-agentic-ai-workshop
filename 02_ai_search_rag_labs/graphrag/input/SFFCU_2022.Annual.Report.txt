A Message from Your Chairperson of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Kristine Wetzel CHAIRPERSON OF THE BOARD
Bill Cheney CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
You Make Our Credit Union Strong
This past year was outstanding for our Members and the Credit Union, thanks to your advocacy and participation. We grew to serve more than 1.2 million Members, welcoming a record 100,734 new Members and, in support of your financial well-being, we saw record loan growth.
You shared how the Credit Union supports you and your family through your engagement with our products and services and willingness to share the value of Membership with others. We were also honored by the recognition we received from you in many national and regional publications throughout 2022. These recognitions are humbling and represent your loyalty and unwavering commitment to the Credit Union.

A Strong Foundation, Built Together
In 2022, our Members benefited from our strong financial position that helped us achieve record financial results. This strength, built by generations of Members including you, allows us to provide trusted financial advice and competitive products to help you achieve financial well-being. Our combined strength continues through all economic cycles, thanks to your loyalty and commitment to sharing the benefits of Membership with your colleagues and family.
Returning Profits to You, Our Member-Owners
As a Member-owned, not-for-profit financial cooperative, we use net revenue to provide you lower rates on loans, higher rates on savings products and lower fees than our for-profit competitors. This past year, SchoolsFirst FCU provided an estimated $277,279,734 in direct financial benefits to our Members, resulting in a savings of $470 for each Member household and $1,297 for Member households actively using more products and services. 1, 2, 3
Growing With You to Serve Your Needs
We help make managing your money easier by listening to your feedback and finding solutions to meet your changing needs. In 2022, we made convenience a priority by launching a self-service debit card PIN feature and an ACH direct payment to loan option. We made improvements to Mobile Banking with new features and design. We also made the dream of homeownership more accessible by launching an FHA home loan program. Additionally, we opened two new branches in two counties.
Giving Back to Our Communities
Together with our Members, we contribute time and financial resources, investing in education and the communities we serve. In 2022, our Members and team helped give back more than $3.84 million to schools, colleges and universities, Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and CUAid, including $285,730 in grants to teachers for educational programs and more than $187,000 in Member Education Award scholarships.
Looking Toward Our Future
Our Credit Union remains strong because of your loyalty and Membership. Our steadfast commitment is to provide World-Class Personal Service and trusted financial advice to help you make financial decisions with confidence and fulfill your dreams.
Thank you for allowing us to serve you. It's an honor to be a trusted part of your life and walk alongside you throughout your financial journey.
With Deep Gratitude,
Kristine Wetzel

MEMBER STORY :selected: :selected:
16
Arnold R. MEMBER SINCE 2021
Arnold works as an occupational therapist, helping students master daily life activities to thrive in the classroom and at home. After a rewarding day at work seeing the progress his students make, Arnold enjoys relaxing in his new home.
Arnold never thought owning a home would be within reach, as no one in his family had ever owned their own home. Instead of following the path he knew and going into a job straight out of high school, Arnold chose to go to college and earned his bachelor's degree. He started a career in finance, with the intent to pull his family out of poverty, but quickly realized that was not his path and went back to school. While in school, Arnold worked as a teaching aide and discovered his passion for working with children with disabilities. He pursued occupational therapy and finished with his master's degree in the subject.
Arnold worked as a contractor for Orange County school districts, before obtaining a full-time position at Santa Ana Unified School District. He works at different school sites within the district - three elementary schools and one preschool. When Arnold opened his Membership in 2021, he was interested in all of the products and services available to school employees and kept the home loan products in the back of his mind.
After obtaining his undergraduate and graduate degrees, Arnold again defied the societal norms of where he grew up by making the leap into home ownership. He recalls that prior to committing to the decision to purchase a home, he called the SchoolsFirst FCU 800-number, knowing nothing and wanting to learn more. The teammember who helped him, Renee, ended up working with him through the entire process from that initial inquiry. "I felt cared for during the process. I was surprised by the level of support I received," Arnold said of his experience. "Renee really helped to keep me calm during a stressful time." Arnold shared that Renee helped him by staying on the phone while he downloaded forms to sign and reassured him along the escrow journey.
Arnold made his dream of homeownership a reality and is grateful to the Credit Union for the help he received during the process.

FINANCIALS
Supervisory Committee Report
The Supervisory Committee provides the Membership with an independent appraisal of the safety and soundness of SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union's operations and activities. It does so in compliance with various financial and regulatory requirements.
In fulfilling these responsibilities, the Committee engaged Moss Adams LLP to perform the annual financial statement audit for the year ended December 31, 2022. Moss Adams issued its opinion that the Credit Union's financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects. In addition, the Committee held quarterly meetings to review, among other things, internal audit reports, internal controls and risk- management processes, and examinations by regulatory agencies.
In the opinion of the Committee, SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union has operated in a financially sound manner and in accordance with applicable federal and state regulations. The Credit Union continues to be financially strong and well-managed, and the assets of the Membership are being effectively safeguarded.
