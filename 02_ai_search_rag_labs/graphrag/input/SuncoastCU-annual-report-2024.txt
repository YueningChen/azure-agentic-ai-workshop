LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN & PRESIDENT/CEO
Dear Suncoast Credit Union Members,
Reflecting on 90 years of serving our members fills us with profound gratitude and appreciation. Throughout 2024, we upheld our longstanding tradition of enhancing our members' financial lives and giving back to our communities.
Our members are everything to us. We are here for you, ready to help you achieve your goals and overcome hardships. We are here with you, as dedicated partners determined to strengthen our communities and face any opportunities or challenges that arise.
Suncoast's strong financial standing allows us to pass meaningful savings back to our members. According to the Credit Union National Association, Suncoast members saved an average of $344 per household last year-thanks to our competitive deposit yields, low fees, and affordable loan rates.
In 2024, we provided affordable loans to almost 200,000 members, generating $6.2 billion in loan originations. In addition, our high return rates on savings contributed to over $1.2 billion in deposit growth, and we closed the year in a solid financial position nearing $18 billion in assets.
Gary C. Gresham Chairman, Board of Directors
Kevin Johnson President and CEO

LETTER
Beyond financial benefits, we are committed to enriching each member's experience through our trusted and caring team. This is reflected in our outstanding member loyalty score of 82.93% and the recognition we received as one of the Best Places to Work in the Tampa Bay Times for 2024.
At Suncoast, our heart extends beyond our walls.
Through the Suncoast Credit Union Foundation, we invested $7.6 million in initiatives that support children and families in our communities. Our employees also demonstrated their unwavering commitment to service, contributing 43,905 volunteer hours throughout our footprint.
On behalf of our board of directors, leadership team, and all of our employees, we are honored to share our 2024 accomplishments in this annual report. Thank you to our members for your unwavering trust in us. We will always be here for you!

2024 HAS BEEN ANOTHER EVENTFUL YEAR FOR SUNCOAST CREDIT UNION
In 2024, Suncoast experienced a year marked by both achievements and challenges, yet we remained steadfast in our commitment to our members. Despite a slowdown in loan growth to 4.6%, we proudly assisted nearly 200,000 members, keeping true to our commitment of "people helping people." External pressures, including inflation and fluctuating interest rates, presented challenges, but we demonstrated exceptional resilience, achieving almost $18 billion in assets, a 2.6% increase from 2023. Our membership grew by 6.7%, adding 80,000 net new members, and we strengthened our reserves by $234 million. Throughout the year, we remained focused on providing practical solutions for our members, positioning ourselves to benefit from the Federal Reserve's decision to reduce rates by 1% to 4.25%, which helped drive growth in both membership and lending during the latter part of 2024.
Key drivers of our loan growth included auto loans, lines of credit, and member business loans, contributing to a total of $6.2 billion in new loans. In an unpredictable rate environment, we maintained a competitive edge by offering attractive rates that fostered member loyalty. Additionally, our savers capitalized on favorable deposit rates, with certificates of deposit growing by over $1.4 billion. Although core deposits saw a modest 1.7% decline due to inflation, our overall deposit 6801 balance grew by a robust 8.7%.
As we look ahead to the uncertainties of the coming year, Suncoast remains resolute in its mission to support our members' financial well-being. Our dedication to serving local communities and enhancing the financial health of our members is unwavering. The Suncoast Board of Directors, management, and staff remain fully committed to safeguarding our members' financial futures and providing exceptional service in the years to come.

HURRICANE ASSISTANCE
One of the most challenging parts of 2024 was the intensity of hurricane season. Many Suncoast members and employees were affected by Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. During difficult times, it is more important than ever to come together and provide the support that's needed.
Suncoast provided lifeline loans, and employees offered their full support to members in their time of need.
EDNA'S STORY
Edna has been a member of Suncoast Credit Union for over 30 years and has her personal as well as her business accounts with Suncoast. She always has a smile on her face and is pleasant to do business with. When she came in after Hurricane Helene, she was in tears. Assistant Branch Manager at the Brandon Service Center, Amy Dwyer, assisted Edna walking her and her husband, Quinton, into her office. Edna looked at Amy and said, "We've lost everything!" They have lived in the same house for over 43 years and have never had any flooding. But this time, the storm flooded their home and destroyed all their furniture, appliances, and personal belongings. Amy gave Edna her personal cell phone number and told her to call if she needed help with anything such as cleaning up or removing their damaged furniture. Edna is 81 years old, and her husband is 90. Edna did call Amy when she learned that Hurricane Milton was heading straight for Tampa. She asked if Amy could help haul off the damaged household belongings that were on her front lawn. Amy and her husband John did not think twice, hooked up John's dump trailer, and went to her house. They loaded up as much as they could ahead of Milton and took it to the dump station. Amy living local knew exactly what threat Edna and Quinton were facing and she didn't hesitate to help a neighbor in need during a stressful time for everyone.

EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES THROUGH ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Our commitment extends beyond just offering products; we provide valuable advice and personalized support to help build long-term, resilient, and stable businesses in our communities. We are proud to offer resources such as SBA Loans and Microloans with non-traditional business lending requirements, like lower credit scores and a shorter length of time in business.
OUR MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM focuses on
three principles - Service, Products, and Partnership. Whether our members are thinking about starting a business, ready to apply for the microloan product or have already received a microloan, they can all benefit from the knowledge provided by our community partners or directly by Suncoast Credit Union.
Our Microenterprise Development Team engages with an average of 75 local entrepreneurs and business owners each month through community development initiatives or referrals from our Suncoast service centers. They also regularly host individual consultations, providing business owners with access to essential resources, skills training and networking opportunities.
FUELING GROWTH WITH INTEGRATED COMMERCIAL & TREASURY SERVICES
Our Suncoast team operates from the perspective that the best commercial banking services aren't just about transactions, they're about relationships. And to achieve this we focus on understanding the needs of our business members and bring forward-looking solutions to help fuel their growth. In 2024 our business members benefited from nearly $460 million in business and commercial loans to take their companies to the next level.

LATONIA'S STORY
Our relationship with Latonia Boykins began more than 20 years ago when we helped her with her first home loan. Today, Latonia is a Suncoast business member who runs two growing businesses, Annie's Assisted Living Facility and Top 2 Bottom Builders. She started Annie's Assisted Living in honor of her grandmother who raised her after her mother passed away. It was under her wing that Latonia learned first- hand that women could maintain, teach, and persevere even in the toughest of times. What a beautiful legacy!
"I love Suncoast Credit Union. When everyone else said no Suncoast said yes," Latonia said. "They gave me an opportunity to break generational curses and change the trajectory of my family. Everyone deserves an opportunity to build a family legacy, and I was fortunate that Suncoast provided the resources."

RACHEL'S STORY
Our Senior Member Advocate at the Brooksville Service Center, Christina Schnorrenberg, has worked with Rachel, a Suncoast member, for many years. Seven years ago, Rachel had the hardest time getting a dependable vehicle as she is on a fixed income. Originally Rachel was declined for a loan when she tried to purchase a vehicle seven years ago and Christina advocated for her and worked with the dealership to get her into something affordable and dependable. This year, on April Ist, Rachel was able to pay off her vehicle! To celebrate this great accomplishment, Christina purchased her flowers and wrote her a handwritten note. The member was so happy she burst into tears. Our members are more than just customers, they're family.

MEMBER'S STORY
A member was inquiring about what will happen to her Suncoast Credit Union account if she files for bankruptcy. Our Senior Member Advocate at the Countryside Service Center, Gracie Burke, took an immediate interest in the member inquiry and asked why she was considering this option. The member shared her nephew was unexpectedly left in her care. This resulted in several expenses, putting her in a predicament where she had to consider bankruptcy. Gracie asked the member if she had considered a consolidation loan, which she had not. At this time, the member's debt was over 50% of her income and her need exceeded $80K. Gracie then inquired about the member's home and the possibility of a Home Equity Line of Credit. With much care and attention, Gracie was able to help the member secure a new loan that actually saved her over $1,400 per month reducing her debt to 30% of her income. Gracie took full ownership of the member's experience and found a solution to help her financial wellness.
We are here for our members not just on their good days, but also during their toughest times.

OUR 2024 NONPROFITS
A HOMERUN FOR THE COMMUNITY
In 2024, we were proud to continue our partnership with the Tampa Bay Rays to provide financial support for local nonprofits. The program, called Every Hit is a Win, is something we look forward to every year - it's a fun and exciting way to engage with our community and benefit local nonprofits in the process. Talk about a win-win!
Each month during baseball season, we hand-picked two local nonprofit organizations with missions aligned with our core values to participate. Each time the Rays scored a hit, Suncoast added $90 to a donation pot (to represent our 90th anniversary).
The nonprofits each had one month to rack up votes on Suncoast's Facebook poll. At the end of the month, the funds were divided between the two organizations based on the percentage of votes they received, so no organization walked away empty-handed. Every hit truly was a win!

SCHOLARSHIPS FOR FIRST-GEN COLLEGE STUDENTS
Our students are the future of our communities, and we do everything we can to help them thrive. In 2024, Suncoast donated $26,000 in scholarships, split between 12 students at Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU), to support tuition costs and other college expenses.
We were thrilled to hear back from some of our scholarship recipients on how their scholarships have helped advance their academic lives!
This scholarship has impacted my life by allowing me to pay for necessities such as books and school materials. It has also lessened some of the financial burden, and in turn, the mental load of putting myself through college. I work full-time to support myself financially, and it can be difficult to focus on school work when feeling financially overwhelmed and burnt out. I am extremely thankful to the scholarship donors and sponsors for providing me with the opportunity to be able to focus more on my studies and excel academically through this scholarship.
Thank you! - Nina Skubala, senior

COMMUNITY
This scholarship will cure the anxiety that ails me and many other first-generation students. I have possessed a job since I was 16 and therefore have been aware of both my own and my family's financial situation for a very long time. Growing up with a haunting awareness of my family's low finances, I did not think college was possible for me. But scholarships like this give people like me a chance. This will cover my books, housing, and possibly even my meal plan. It strengthens my drive to complete my schooling knowing there are people out there who have enough faith in me to support me in college.
-Anastasia Cusmano, freshman
This scholarship has helped me tremendously with wanting to further my education beyond just a bachelor's degree. Throughout my time at FGCU I have realized that there are many activities that I want to do but some I am not able to because of lack of funds. FGCU scholarships have helped me throughout my time already because I have the option to look outside of a bachelor's degree and think of higher education.

HURRICANE RELIEF AFTER HELENE & MILTON
2024 was rough on our community, with back- to-back monster hurricanes leaving entire areas devastated. Hurricanes Helene and Milton took the homes, belongings, businesses, and livelihoods of so many Floridians, and we knew it was our responsibility to help them recover.
As Florida began rebuilding in the aftermath of the hurricanes, Suncoast pledged $850,000 in donations to support recovery efforts across the state. The funds were distributed across 13 nonprofit organizations to provide crisis management, hunger relief, and educational support in the areas left most vulnerable by the storms.
Here are the organizations we donated to:
· AMERICAN RED CROSS
· TRI-COUNTY RESOURCE CENTER
. UNITED WAY SUNCOAST
· FEEDING TAMPA BAY
· HILLSBOROUGH EDUCATION FOUNDATION
. CHARLOTTE EDUCATION FOUNDATION
· EDUCATION FOUNDATION OF MANATEE COUNTY
· PASCO EDUCATION FOUNDATION
· EDUCATION FOUNDATION OF SARASOTA COUNTY
. DIXIE BOARD OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION
. GILCHRIST EDUCATION FOUNDATION
· LEVY EDUCATION FOUNDATION

We spoke with some of the nonprofits we're supporting about how Suncoast's funding will help advance their hurricane recovery efforts. Here's what they had to say:
In the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, many families in our region have been left struggling to access food and basic necessities. This $75,000 contribution will allow us to provide immediate food assistance through emergency distributions, mobile pantries, and meal kits for those hardest hit by the storms. With Suncoast's support, we can ensure that thousands of individuals and families receive the nourishment they need as they begin to rebuild their lives.
- Feeding Tampa Bay President and CEO Thomas Mantz
As the only full-service social services provider in Dixie, Levy, and Gilchrist counties, we serve as a critical lifeline for families impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Suncoast's generous support of $100,000 will help us provide emergency housing, food, and essential bill pay assistance, as well as meet unique needs like replacing medical equipment. This funding ensures we can continue to respond quickly and effectively to our community's most urgent needs.
- Tri-County Resource Center Manager Beverly Goodman
We are deeply thankful for Suncoast Credit Union's $250,000 contribution toward our hurricane relief efforts. This vital support allows us to provide immediate assistance to those impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, offering food, shelter, relief supplies, and critical services like emotional and spiritual care. Suncoast's generosity will also help sustain the vehicles, warehouses, and dedicated teams that make our work possible. Any funds remaining after emergency needs are met will be directed toward long-term recovery, ensuring that affected communities can rebuild stronger and more resilient.
- American Red Cross of Central Florida CEO Michael D. Brown
This $75,000 in funding enables us to activate our collective impact model by providing immediate assistance to those in need, while also helping the nonprofit organizations we partner with navigate resources like insurance, FEMA, and other emergency relief options. Suncoast's support will make a significant difference in the mid- to long-term recovery for countless individuals and families, ensuring they receive the grants, supplies, and financial assistance necessary to rebuild and move forward.
- United Way of Suncoast CEO Jessica Muroff

TRI-COUNTY COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTER
When we asked Beverly Goodman, the Executive Director of Tri-County Resource Center, about their most pressing needs, we learned it's the little things. Suncoast's funding helped more than 40 clients struggling to pay for various up-front costs required to re-enter the workforce.
· A single mother paid for and successfully completed a CNA Prep Course to secure a new job at a major healthcare facility. Thriving in her new role, she said she was happier than ever and truly loves her job, marking a significant milestone in her journey toward stability and fulfillment.
. A single mother who left an abusive relationship to relocate to Florida paid for fees to transfer her real estate license, which helped her find a second job working with a local realtor. With the increased income, she is able to support her family and her children are thriving.
Suncoast's support has provided a lifeline via Tri-County Resource Center to those who've hit financial roadblocks, providing resources like:
o A bicycle to get to and from work
o Nursing scrubs and nonskid shoes to reenter the workforce
o Replacement photo ID to accept job offer
o Steel-toe boots
o Teaching certificate fee
It's a privilege to be able to stand hand-in-hand with organizations like Tri-County Resource Center to help change the trajectory of people's lives for the better.

FINANCIAL EDUCATION CHANGES LIVES:
DR. ARTHUR BOYER FOUNDATION INC.
In 2024 and beyond, we're on a mission to make financial education accessible to everyone. After Suncoast received a request in Creole from Dr. Arthur Boyer Foundation, Inc., we realized that we still had work to do.

Located in Immokalee, Dr. Arthur Boyer Foundation, Inc. is a 501(c )(3) nonprofit on a mission to inspire and strengthen community development through a transformational sharing culture. Prior to their request, Suncoast didn't have any educational content in Creole. Instead of turning the organization away, we went into problem-solving mode.
Our team contacted the Immokalee branch. Jeff Mendes, a Member Advocate at the branch, selflessly offered to translate two presentations and present both of them in Creole! Jeff's initiative helped 65 Creole-speaking students receive financial education from Suncoast and prompted amazing feedback and a special thank-you from Dr. Boyer:
"I thank you very much for two great presentations. That was very informative. The decision to have it in Creole was instrumental. Presenter was phenomenal. As one student who attended both sessions claimed, the presentation has changed her life. They are all so grateful for that opportunity."
We believe that each and every student deserves valuable financial education, regardless of their native language. We owe it to Jeff Mendes for going above and beyond to help us prove it.

FINANCIAL FOOTBALL 2024
At Suncoast, we believe in the power of financial education, and it's never too early to start learning. That's why we host Financial Football, an annual high school program that provides financial education to students through interactive gameplay.
How it works: students are divided into teams and asked to answer financial questions. For each correct answer, teams earn points and a chance to win cash prizes totaling over $3,000, plus their school's name on the coveted Financial Football trophy.
On February 6th, 2024, we hosted our 14th annual Financial Football Tournament. Teamwork makes the dream work, and this year, the students came to win!

STUDENT RUN BRANCHES
Immersive experience is the best teacher. Suncoast's Student Run Branches (SRBs) allow students to gain valuable skills by taking on roles like Branch Manager, Marketing Manager, and Teller, accepting applications and deposits from students and staff members alike.
Suncoast staff works with the student branch staff to spread awareness of the credit union difference through campaigns and seminars, which are all led by the students! SRBs affect students by challenging them with new experiences and allowing them to gain technical and interpersonal skills that will enhance their résumés and give them a competitive edge when applying for jobs and college.
