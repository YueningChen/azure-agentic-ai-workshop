Bethpage 3 IS NOW FOUR & LEAF Federal Credit Union
2024 Annual Report
YEAR IN REVIEW
Message from the President
Linda ama
&
2024 was an exciting year of growth and achievements. We continued to proudly provide our members with great rates, innovative products, and excellent service to help them realize their dreams. With this, we saw significant expansion and development in 2024. We added over 49,000 new members and grew by $915 million in deposits. We provided $749 million in residential mortgages and $2.3 billion in consumer loans.
In 2024 we were immensely proud to receive Great Place to WorkÂ® Certification for the second year in a row. This incredible achievement means our employees continue to feel respected, take pride in their work, and care about each other. Our people make our culture great, and we will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that we truly are a great place to work for everyone.
We remained committed to our partnerships and programs that help the communities in which we do business grow and thrive. A testament to this was our record-breaking 16th Annual Turkey Drive. With your generosity, we collected 5,800 turkeys, more than 28,000 pounds of food, and over $71,000 in donations to help those facing food insecurity on Long Island. We will continue prioritizing giving back to our communities through employee volunteering, charitable giving, and more in the coming year.
66 ... it is more than just a rebrand. It represents our commitment to growth and prosperity and comes at a time when we are stronger than ever.
In October 2024, we launched a powerful new movement in the banking industry. Money Like A Woman was designed to promote financial inclusivity and bring awareness to women's unique and collaborative mindset that enables all individuals, families, and communities to thrive. This movement was created as an extension of the work we do to facilitate positive change and make an impact in the communities we serve across Long Island, the tri-state area, and beyond. We are excited by the buzz Money Like A Woman has created in the marketplace and have started to see its positive impact through membership.
A major announcement made in 2024 was the rebranding of Bethpage Federal Credit Union (Bethpage). After many months of extensive research, including conducting member, non-member, and employee surveys, it was determined that most people perceived that Bethpage is small and local, and they could only bank with us if they lived or worked in the area. This data showed that it was time for a name change, especially given our expansion and opening of new branches in Queens and New Jersey. Bethpage officially changed its name to FourLeaf Federal Credit Union (FourLeaf) in March 2025, and it is more than just a rebrand. It represents our commitment to growth and prosperity and comes at a time when we are stronger than ever.
I am grateful for your support and membership this past year. We look forward to this new chapter as FourLeaf Federal Credit Union and to providing a best-in-class experience well into the future.
Sincerely, Linda Armyn President and CEO
Message from the Chair
June h. Brings
An integral part of FourLeaf Federal Credit Union's vision is to enrich lives in the communities we serve. Now in its 23rd year, the Bethpage Cares program provided $2 million in financial support to the community in 2024. We supported 79 charitable and community organizations focused on education, housing, family services, and food insecurity, all of which support our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our teammates also came together to make a difference in the lives of others by volunteering close to 4,000 hours in the community.
The FourLeaf Air Show at Jones Beach has become the largest and most highly anticipated event on Long Island. With its signature high-flying stunts and aerial maneuvers of the U.S. military and other incredible performers, attendees are left in awe year after year.
In 2024, an astounding 353,000 people gathered on the beach to kick off the summer and honor the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice on our nation's behalf. We look forward to seeing what the Air Show has in store for us all this year, with the US Air Force Thunderbirds headlining.
Our Volunteer Income Tax Assistance/Tax Counseling for the Elderly (VITA/ TCE) program celebrated its 21st year in 2024. It is the largest program of its kind on Long Island, offering free income tax preparation services to families with low to moderate incomes. We were able to prepare 892 tax returns, bringing over $1.1 million in tax refunds to Long Island families and our local economy. Since our involvement with the VITA/TCE tax program, we have completed 25,919 returns in the last 21 years, with more than $30.6 million invested back into the community.
Another rewarding accomplishment in 2024 was our continued partnership with Island Harvest, which helped fulfill their mission of ending hunger on Long Island through our 16th Annual Turkey Drive. Our teammates and community came together and showed record-setting generosity by donating 5,800 frozen turkeys and over 28,000 pounds of non-perishables for those in need during the holiday season. In addition, we raised an impressive $71 thousand from the Turkey Drive and online donations.
On behalf of our board of directors, leadership team, and entire staff, thank you for being our member. We look forward to another fulfilling year of service to you and our communities.
Sincerely, Anne N. Brigis Chair of the Board

Supervisory Committee's Report
The Supervisory Committee provides independent monitoring and review of the operations of FourLeaf Federal Credit Union ("FourLeaf"), ensuring that management's financial reporting is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and that its practices and procedures safeguard members' assets. The Supervisory Committee is comprised of four independent volunteers who act as member representatives and are fully committed to you, the members of FourLeaf.
In fulfilling its statutory duties and obligations, the Supervisory Committee monitors to ensure policies are established by the Board of Directors, and there are effective procedures to comply with laws and regulations, to minimize the risk of fraud, and to avoid conflicts of interest. Through FourLeaf's internal audit staff and consultants, the Supervisory Committee performs assessments of business processes, using a risk-based approach, to ensure policies are effective and properly administered.
The Supervisory Committee appoints the independent auditor and oversees the annual financial statement audit. In 2024, the public accounting firm Moss Adams LLP was retained to conduct the annual audit of the financial statements, in conformity with federal regulations, for the 12 months ending December 31. In addition, the National Credit Union Administration ("NCUA") evaluated FourLeaf's financial condition, safety, soundness, and areas of regulatory compliance.
Based on the results of both the Independent Auditor's Report and the Examination Report of the NCUA, it is the opinion of your Supervisory Committee that FourLeaf continues to be financially strong and well managed, with sound policies and programs. The 2024 audited financial statements can be found on our website.
