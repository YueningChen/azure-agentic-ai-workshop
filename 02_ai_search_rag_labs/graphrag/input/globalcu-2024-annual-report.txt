The Board of Directors' and President's Report
Since it was chartered in 1948, Global's mission has been to provide financial services to members affordably, conveniently, and professionally. Throughout the credit union's 76 years of operations, it has remained true to its original purpose of providing members with a safe place to save while earning at highly competitive rates and simultaneously being a source of low-cost credit.
STRENGTH IN MEMBERS
2024 was a challenging year for financial institutions of Global's asset size. The repercussions of the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes throughout 2022 and 2023 continued to reverberate throughout the economy and consumer spending. Despite the relatively small rate reductions in the latter part of 2024, overall rate volatility remained a significant obstacle for businesses, consumers, and financial institutions.
Notwithstanding these and other economic obstacles, the credit union achieved a remarkable 224% increase in net income over 2023, finishing the year with near record levels of membership, deposits, loans, net worth, and assets. At year end, the credit union's membership totaled 768,993, with assets totaling $11.48 billion and a net worth of $1.20 billion.
Global implemented and built upon several strategic initiatives to achieve these positive results and ensure the credit union remains financially strong into the future and a vital element in the everyday lives of its members.

BETTER THAN BANKING
As a result of major shifts in consumer behaviors, expectations, and preferences over the past several years, the credit union focused its efforts and resources on digital transformation while enhancing member experience through branch and contact center delivery channels. These efforts continued to pay off in 2024, as the credit union processed 747 million transactions and 61,776 new loans totaling $3.40 billion.
As a member-owned cooperative, Global transfers value to its members by providing services more cost effectively than other financial organizations. To measure the credit union's success in this regard, the value transferred is rigorously calculated based on the dollar benefit Global members receive from higher rates on deposits, lower loan rates, and lower fees compared to those of competing banking institutions. We are pleased to report that this value transfer to members in 2024 was a record $195.3 million, an approximate return of $254 per member, the highest recorded to date.

PEOPLE HELPING PEOPLE
In addition to returning profits back to members, Global is committed to making the communities in which it operates a better place to live. Through corporate giving and community support programs, Global raised over $670,000 that was contributed to nonprofit organizations in more than 50 distinct communities. Additionally, employees along with a match, donated more than $30,000 to the United Way in 2024.
Charitable contributions weren't limited to the credit union and its employees; credit union members and partners donated more than $412,000 to annual fundraisers coordinated by the Global Credit Union Foundation, an organization that directly funds needs-based services to children, Veterans, and active-duty members of the armed services. While financial support of nonprofit organizations is incredibly important to the cooperative mission of the credit union, Global employees in Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Washington, and Italy also volunteered tens of thousands of hours supporting nonprofit organizations they are passionate about.

SERVICE FIRST
In terms of service, numerous enhancements were made during the year that were designed to make the credit union more convenient for members. At year end, the credit union operated 72 branches, which includes eight financial centers in four states as well as a U.S. based 24/7/365 contact center, which enjoyed higher levels of member service scores over the previous year. Global also enhanced its fraud protection program in 2024, ensuring members' information and their money is secure.
Another way the credit union measures its success in serving members is by conducting regular surveys asking members their opinion about the level of service the credit union provides. This member service survey has been conducted each month for the last 26 years. 2024 survey responses revealed very strong levels of member service satisfaction, including record scores in three of the twelve months. In addition, the credit union received numerous awards and recognitions reflecting its excellent member and client services, including being named one of Forbes magazine's "Best in State" credit unions in several states in which it operates.
The credit union exists to serve its members, but we cannot effectively perform that function without each of the skilled and valuable employees who work diligently to ensure members have access to their money. We were inspired by Global's 1,960 dedicated employees and want to thank them for their extraordinary efforts. Global remains committed to enhancing employee engagement, satisfaction, and training and development.

GLOBAL FUTURE
We are confident that Global's experience, sound business philosophies and practices, and strong financial foundation position the credit union well to meet the many challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. We are certain that Global's 76th year of operation will be another year of success in serving members' financial needs. We want to thank the membership for their seven- plus decades of support and participation in the credit union. We also want to congratulate and thank the volunteer officials and all the employees for their service to members and contributions to the credit union in 2024.

Commitment to Community
WEAR R.E.D. CAMPAIGN
Global employees jumped at another chance to take part in the annual Wear R.E.D. Campaign, a heartfelt initiative to honor and support the men and women of the armed services. The campaign ran from Memorial Day through Patriot Day, with employees sporting red T-shirts to mark the occasion. Shirts were available to anyone who requested them, and Wear R.E.D. pins were given to any member who requested one.
Given the opportunity, Global will always show up to help foster a sense of unity and appreciation for the troops. We cannot thank you enough for your service and sacrifice.

Commitment to Community
AIR SHOW SUPPORT
Global's commitment to the communities it serves was in full display through our sponsorships at local air shows in several markets, including Anchorage, Spokane, and Glendale. These events provide an excellent opportunity for Global volunteers to connect with our neighbors, foster stronger community ties, and showcase our support for military families.
We can always count on the volunteers from Team Global to show up, help out, and highlight what it means to be part of the Global Credit Union family.

Commitment to Community
UNITED WAY
Global's long-standing relationship with the United Way reached new heights in 2024 and included a series of fundraising activities coordinated by both organizations. In Alaska and Arizona, Team Global assembled breakfast packs for local nonprofit programs focused on eliminating childhood hunger. In Washington, over a dozen employees gathered with the Red Cross to assemble more than 180 home-essentials bags for new recruits at Fairchild Air Force Base. We applaud the work the United Way does to improve our communities and look forward to continuing our work with them for many years to come.

GIVING TREE
The Giving Tree initiative was a holiday donation drive organized at Global Credit Union office locations. On display were trees adorned with hollow ornaments that contained gift requests. Employees then chose an ornament and purchased the requested items. This initiative brought immense joy to many of our neighbors during the holiday season by providing gifts to children and much-needed items to families in need.

Commitment to Community
KIDS DAY AT THE ZOO
We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to take part in the amazing activities our communities have to offer, whether they can afford it or not. That's why each year the credit union covers the cost for kids aged 3 to 17 to visit the Alaska Zoo on Kids Day in Anchorage.
Kids Day gets bigger every year, with 2024 having the largest number of families attending to date. More than 3,000 Alaskans walked through the gates for a fun-filled day of family, fur, face painting, animal enrichment, prizes and giveaways, photos, and more!
An unforgettable time was had by guests and volunteers alike, and we can't wait to do it again next year.

Supervisory Committee Report
SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE REPORT
The credit union's Supervisory Committee is comprised of five volunteer members who function as the credit union's audit committee. It is the Committee's responsibility to ensure: internal controls are effectively maintained; accounting records and reports are promptly prepared and accurately reflect the results of operations; the operation of the credit union is in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors; and member account inquiries are promptly and fairly considered. Your Supervisory Committee has fulfilled these responsibilities during the past year as follows:
¬ª Retained Crowe Horwath, a certified public accounting firm, to conduct the credit union's annual audit;
¬ª Worked with the credit union's Internal Audit department to ensure that internal controls were maintained;
¬ª Responded directly to members with account inquiries;
¬ª Completed a random sample verification of member account balances and of closed accounts through direct correspondence; and
¬ª Met regularly, and as required, to consider matters that were within the Supervisory Committee's area of responsibility.
It is our opinion that the enclosed financial statements fairly and accurately reflect the financial condition of Global Credit Union on December 31, 2024, and that the credit union operates and is managed on a sound basis, in accordance with current federal regulations.
