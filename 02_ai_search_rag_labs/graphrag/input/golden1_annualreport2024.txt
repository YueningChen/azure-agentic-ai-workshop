Golden 1 Credit Union
A message from the
Board of Directors
Golden 1 Credit Union continued to focus on improving the financial lives of Californians in 2024, ending the year with robust financial strength and security for our more than 1.1 million members. We proudly delivered exceptional financial services and support to empower our members and communities, despite the complexities and rapid changes in the financial services industry.
Supported and driven by the dedication of our more than 2,000 employees, Golden 1 continued to provide our members with financial products that met their diverse needs, dreams, and goals. We ended 2024 as one of the top 10 credit unions in the nation, with nearly $20 billion in assets and a net income of $106.7 million. We maintained our role as a vital source of credit for our members, and closed the year with $14.6 billion in loans. Golden 1 also continued to be a safe haven for our members' deposits, maintaining $17.4 billion on deposit as of year-end. The Credit Union also remained financially secure with a healthy net capital position of 10.34 percent to finish the year.
In 2024, Golden 1 created a more equitable and financially inclusive California by providing easy access to the financial solutions, resources, and support that helped our members and communities improve their well-being. We launched Easy Checking, a BankOn-certified checking product, to assist members new to banking or with less-than-perfect financial histories. Golden 1 also backed organizations creating positive change in communities across the state. From partnerships to support students' educational journeys to connecting members with local nonprofit and government resources, Golden 1 addressed a wide range of financial needs. We also proudly became the first California credit union to partner with the California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) to assist first-generation homebuyers.
Golden 1 enhanced financial well-being across California last year, helping our valued members achieve their financial goals. We supported more than 17,600 members and consumers through a variety of financial empowerment initiatives, including one-on-one financial coaching, workshops, Financial Wellness Challenges at high schools and universities, Financial Empowerment podcasts, and digital financial learning tools.
We also focused on accelerating digital innovation, welcoming 106,000 members to our digital channels.
In addition to supporting members in times of need, Golden 1 also forged partnerships to strengthen our communities. In 2024, we donated more than $3.6 million to support community and student food banks, fund youth education and development, and advance social and financial equity. This included contributing more than $1 million to 42 nonprofits dedicated to enhancing community infrastructure, economic revitalization, and opportunity in a low-income, predominantly minority community of Sacramento. Golden 1 is devoted to expanding our social and community impact programs to uplift underserved communities throughout California.
We were proud to once again receive numerous national, state, and local accolades throughout 2024. Golden 1 was recognized as one of "America's Best-In-State Credit Unions" by Forbes, named "Best Banks and Credit Unions in California" by Money, listed as one of "America's Greatest Workplaces" by Newsweek, and honored as one of "America's Best Mid-Size Companies" by TIME Magazine, to name a few. These recognitions showcase Golden 1's dedication to our members, employees, and communities we serve throughout California. We are incredibly thankful for our employees and their unwavering commitment to delivering exceptional service and empowering our members and communities.
As a devoted, trusted, and caring partner, Golden 1 continues to exemplify its vision to be the best at improving financial lives of Californians. We care with heart. We serve with pride. We deliver with excellence. Thank you for being a valued member and allowing us the privilege to serve your financial needs!

Annual Report of the Audit Committee
One of the core values of Golden 1 Credit Union is reliability. We strive to ensure that Golden 1 members can rely on our financial strength and security. With this in mind, the Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that Credit Union policies and procedures protect our members' interests. We are also responsible for providing reasonable assurance that the regulations, policies, and procedures that govern the organization are properly followed, and for providing an annual report on the Credit Union's financial condition and the results of its operations.
The Committee is assisted in carrying out its responsibilities by our Audit Services and Compliance Departments. The Credit Union is also periodically examined by regulatory agencies, such as the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation and the National Credit Union Administration.
We retained the services of the independent accounting firm of Moss Adams LLP, Certified Public Accountants, to perform an audit of the Credit Union's financial statements as of December 31, 2024. In their opinion, the balance sheets and related statements of income present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations for Golden 1 Credit Union in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
We wish to express our appreciation to the Board of Directors, management, and staff for their continued support.

Golden 1 History
Golden 1 Credit Union has a rich history that began in 1933 when 11 state employees in Sacramento formed the California State Employees' Credit Union #1.
Their vision was to bring hard-working people together to pool their financial resources to help one another prosper.
Over the decades, Golden 1 has been committed to providing exceptional service and has grown to become one of the nation's largest credit unions, with nearly $20 billion in assets and more than one million members in California.
In the 1950s, the Credit Union saw steady growth, reaching $1 million in assets by 1952 and moving into its first permanent office in 1961.
CALIFORNIA STATE EMPLOYEES' CREDIT UNION NR I
The 1970s marked a significant milestone with the name change to Golden 1 Credit Union and assets reaching $100 million by 1977.
The Golden CREDIT UNION
1
The 1980s and 1990s were periods of rapid expansion and innovation. Golden 1 introduced its first ATMs in 1982 and launched its website in 1998. By the end of the 20th century, membership had grown to more than 400,000, and assets had surpassed $3 billion.
The Credit Union continued to innovate in the 2000s, introducing Mobile and Online Banking Services and expanding its branch network across the state.
In 2015, the Credit Union obtained the naming rights to Golden 1 Center, one of the most technologically advanced arenas in the world, and shortly thereafter assets exceeded $10 billion. By 2018, membership had surpassed one million, and Golden 1 became the first state-chartered credit union to be granted a statewide field of membership in California.
Golden 1 CENTER
In 2023, the Credit Union introduced updated Mission and Vision statements, galvanizing its position as a purpose-driven, member-centric organization. Proof of this commitment included new offerings and products designed to help those who are underserved or new to financial services. Golden 1 also committed $10 million in financial support to envelop and uplift a low-income, majority-minority community in Sacramento. In 2024, the first Golden 1 Financial Resource Center was opened offering specialized advice, education, and one-on-one coaching tailored to members' unique needs.
Golden 1 has long been recognized for its exceptional member service, community involvement, and as a top employer. With the development and expansion of Business Services products, the Credit Union's work to serve small businesses and further support economic development across its diverse communities has continued to grow. This focus will continue into 2025 and beyond.
From Golden 1's humble beginnings in 1933 to being a nearly $20 billion organization with over 1.1 million members statewide today, the Credit Union has consistently delivered exceptional financial services and support to empower members and communities. Over the years Golden 1 has consistently been recognized both locally and nationally for its exceptional member service, employee engagement, and community impact. Golden 1 was proud to be named one of "America's Best-In-State Credit Unions" and one of "America's Best-In-State Employers" by Forbes - just to name a few.
With a strong foundation and forward-looking approach, Golden 1 is well-positioned to continue serving Californians and pursuing its mission to deliver exceptional financial services and support to empower its members and communities. The best is yet to come.
