-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [credit_union, member, board_of_directors, volunteer, staff, branch, financial_report, foundation, scholarship, grant, loan, community_involvement, philanthropy, financial_service, governance_structure, membership, survey_tool, digital_banking, mobile_app, financial_education, non_profit, charitable_organization, investment, asset, liability, equity, operating_expense, net_income, audit_committee, regulatory_agency, financial_statement, real_estate, mortgage, credit_card, consumer_loan, vehicle_loan, retirement_plan, 401k_plan, lease, property_and_equipment, community_event, partnership, fraud_protection, technology_infrastructure, military_banking, scholarship_program, financial_literacy, youth_program, housing_initiative, food_drive, employee, customer_experience, awards_and_recognition]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

serve you now and in the future. Our assets and earnings were strong as noted in our full financial report, and our operating expenses were well-managed, demonstrating good stewardship of your money. We were also thrilled to welcome thousands of new members to our Credit Union family, up nearly 70,000 from 2023. This growth has been consistent year over year.
That cooperative spirit also drives us to make a difference in our communities, as we unite for a common good to uplift our friends, neighbors, and fellow North Carolinians through community involvement and philanthropic efforts. SECU members, staff, and volunteers joined forces to collect school supplies for teachers and students, food to help fill our local pantries, and toys and gifts for North Carolina children and families to have a brighter holiday season. They also gave of their time to volunteer with local non-profits to make a positive impact for others. In just the first part of 2024, SECU team members logged more than 8,000 volunteer hours to give back to their communities.
Speaking of impact, I must take a moment to highlight our incredible member-funded SECU Foundation, which is the largest charitable organization in the credit union industry. Established in 2004, SECU Foundation is celebrating a major milestone - its 20th anniversary of transformative work in our great state. To date, the Foundation has committed over $300 million in scholarships, grants, and loans for education, housing, healthcare, and human services initiatives to benefit the people and communities in all 100 North Carolina counties. Through your generosity, SECU Foundation is creating positive and lasting change, and I encourage you to visit www. ncsecufoundation.org to learn even more about this important work.
I have been a proud member of SECU since 1996 and on the Board of Directors since 2016. I am truly honored to serve our cooperative and provide representation for my fellow members. In closing, I want to give a heartfelt thank you to our dedicated staff of over 8,000 who serve in SECU's 275 branches, the Member Services Support Center, and operations departments positioned all across North Carolina. I, along with my fellow Board members, also offer our sincere gratitude to the more than 3,000 SECU volunteers serving on committees and branch Advisory Boards. We appreciate all that you do to represent our members and SECU. And to our 2.8 million members, thank you for your membership and your support. You are at the heart of all that we do, and you are the difference for SECU!
Sincerely, minin
Mona Moon Chair, SECU Board of Directors
The Cooperative Difference
Born out of compassion for others and the desire for positive change, State Employees' Credit Union was formed by 17 individuals on June 4, 1937, in the basement of the Agriculture Building in Raleigh, North Carolina. After watching their co-workers, family, and friends being taken advantage of by dishonest lenders, our founders knew there was a better way - one that could make a real difference. In a bold move, they pooled their resources, a total of $437, and created a trusted place where fellow state employees and their families could save and borrow money at fair and equitable rates for all.

Since the beginning, SECU has been grounded in the philosophy of People Helping PeopleÂ® with a mission of service - to be the trusted provider of financial services to every eligible member and to enhance the value of their lives and financial well-being while maintaining our fiscal strength. A lot has changed in the last 87 years, as much work has been done to enhance and expand SECU's products, services, and delivery channels to best meet members' constantly evolving needs. However, through it all, the philosophy, mission, and member-driven focus have remained steadfast, and the cooperative difference is highlighted throughout the pages of this 2024 Annual Report to the Membership.

THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
Listening To Members ...
Roadshow in Lenoir, North Carolina
The trusted relationships built with members since 1937 are foundational to the success of SECU. As a member-owned cooperative, gathering feedback from members is central to helping guide the Board and SECU leadership to make decisions that best serve the needs of all members. To enhance member communications, SECU implemented even more feedback tools over the past year. The Credit Union now has the capability to email members who have an active email address on file, helping to provide more information through e-newsletters, important notices, and marketing messages highlighting new and improved offerings. Over 1.2 million members are currently receiving these emails, and the goal is to expand that distribution to even more of SECU's 2.8 million members.
SECU also began a graduated rollout of a new chat feature with the SECU Mobile App to complement its online and direct communications with members. Chat is currently available 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday-Friday with plans to expand availability in the coming year.
A new member survey tool was also implemented that provides continuous feedback through SECU's various service channels. In addition to gaining greater insight into member satisfaction, this tool has been helpful with gathering input on specific topics such as the proposed changes to SECU's Board Election Policies and Procedures that were approved by the Board
