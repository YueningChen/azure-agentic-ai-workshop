# Azure Agentic AI Workshop

Welcome to the **Azure Agentic AI Workshop** â€” a hands-on, structured learning experience designed to help business and technical participants explore and build solutions using Azure's Agent AI capabilities.

## Workshop Goals

This workshop is designed to:
- Introduce participants to the core concepts of Agentic AI
- Demonstrate how to build intelligent agents using Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Search, and Semantic Kernel
- Provide hands-on labs and guided exercises to reinforce learning
- Enable participants to prototype real-world use cases

## Intended Audience

This workshop is ideal for:
- **Business stakeholders** looking to understand the potential of Agent AI in their domain
- **Technical professionals** (developers, architects, data scientists) interested in building intelligent, context-aware agents using Azure

## Key Technologies
